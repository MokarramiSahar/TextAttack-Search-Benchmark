Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing. \nAlso, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide. \nAnd they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years.

Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \""fixed\"" it for free, and the very next morning I [[had]] the same issue. I called to complain, and the \""manager\"" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too.

The food is good. Unfortunately the [[service]] is [[very]] hit or miss. The main [[issue]] seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty [[obvious]] that some of them avoid the tables after [[taking]] the initial [[order]] to avoid hearing complaints.

[[Even]] when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \n\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the [[usual]] department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.\n\nI like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . .

Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding [[party]] - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is [[fine]] but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I [[made]] eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.

Though, I am somewhat disappointed that they've [[switched]] to a lower grade [[ice]] milk, for their vanilla and chocolate offerings.

It's mostly street parking, though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here, is the same size as a DQ large. And the large is SO big, they can't fit it through the window-they hand it out the side door.\n\nIf you want a real \""Kodak moment\""-order a large cone for the kids, and keep the camera, and wet wipes handy!

When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair [[end]] of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was [[charged]] $250 for a [[tune]] up and a few other things. [[Granted]] this included installing a sew up tire (which I can [[understand]] would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down [[tube]] (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \""Should be ready in a few days\"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \""duke it over\"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?

This is my go-to distributer. They [[have]] a great selection and lots of [[hard]] to find brews.

As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\"". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.\n\nTasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\n\n- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier

Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. \n\nWe were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. \n\nOur waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.\n\nThe meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very [[stale]] and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. \n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very [[cold]] and the [[octopus]] had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \n\nThe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \n\nFinally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). \n\nAfter that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return.

The cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect.\n\nWhen I adopted one of my cats at this establishment, I had to return the next day to have her spayed.

I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...\n\nI have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.\n\nThier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.  \n\nI can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.\n\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.

I cannot sing Tim Walter's praises loud enough.\n\nI have taken my car to him for about 5 years, and I always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness. If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you're not sure what it is, you can just stop by, and he'll usually take a break from what he's working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly [[honest]] and cares about his customers. For instance, once I [[had]] a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks, so I had him do it because it wasn't an emergency and I'd rather give him my business. He's awesome.

When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu [[really]] jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is [[so]] popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I [[had]] planned additional time to park and was delightfully [[reminded]] that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, [[especially]] with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread [[came]] with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!

What a [[gem]] of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have [[drunk]] from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \n\""Would you care for some dessert?\"", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.

Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is vast, and the price is right. They [[have]] [[so]] many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose. I'm a big [[fan]] of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here.

I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside.

I recently bought my first motorcycle (a 2001 KTM Duke II) and found Bohn's when searching online for KTM dealers. I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \n\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \""hated\"" that jacket and that the liner was \""nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\"" Ok...\n\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\n\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\n\nI wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent, so if you are in the area and know what you want, it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative, though, I would avoid this place.

Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the [[end]] of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our [[check]] did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.

The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too [[heavy]] and [[altogether]] flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was [[cooked]] well and the sauce was fine though.

Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  [[So]] I [[grabbed]] a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two [[employees]] came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""what's going on here\"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""Uh-oh\"".  The menu is huge with a number of \""slow-food\"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""bacon\"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""meat\"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.

I lived in Pittsburgh for four years and have never been to D's, but I visited recently and went with some friends. What lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers, and I was not let down. I got two hot dogs--a Chicago and a mac and cheese. Really, really good. My boyfriend ordered the Red Alert dog (his was meat) and his face basically melted off, but he insisted he loved it. Then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts, but to each his own. He [[had]] a great time. My two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it. \nThe beer cave is awesome. \nI'd love to give D's five stars, but like a couple of people mentioned, the service is lacking. Everyone is friendly, but I had to walk around and find our server so I could pay, and then find him again when he didn't return. It took us a while to get water refills, too. The dining area and the bar are separated, and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though.

Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans).

We took the drive to Swissvale and got us a \""Battleship\"" and it was literally 3 [[hoofs]] long, just the [[whatsoever]] amount of veggies and meat and delicious.  It was 2 meals worth of food (for two people).  [[Conversely]] better the next day.  And the best part was that it was under 13 bucks.  \n\nIt's great, fast food.

Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or \""PAT\"") operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail.

I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\""Miss Pat\""--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \""free\"" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \""oughts\"" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \""busways,\"" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \""T\"" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \""smart card\"" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.

Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here.

Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian [[bread]] served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: [[terrible]] flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not [[necessarily]] opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""bacon\"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.

But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location.

Oh, if you buy a plantain that is pitch-black, or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitch-black, simply slice them open, place in oven, bake until warm and tender, then spread with guava paste (available at Reyna Foods). So the man at the counter tells me. True story.

I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived, I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the [[batter]] was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but [[turns]] out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a [[cool]] place in my book. I'll be back! :P

Prime time location, and they know it.\n\nYet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland's because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a \""lobster roll\"" so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster, but was [[fishy]] tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic.\nService was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.\n\nGo to Wholey!!!!

Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!\n\nAnd it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.\n\nTalk about false advertisement...

I liked the bar.   The food not at all. First time here, wife and I [[sat]] at the [[bar]] and people watched over some [[WELL]] POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we screwed up and ordered food.   I got their infamous [[lobster]] roll.  Glad I had a drink.  Overcooked and dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was [[dry]] and chewy.  Lots of it, though  I guess that accounts for the [[high]] price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife's nachos were just a big pile of [[chips]] with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day,  we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were terrible (pepperoni, sausage.  how can youscrew that up, but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress' feelings.  But it went into the trashcan down the street.  Go for the hootch and not the food!!

Why does it seem that Pittsburgh [[wants]] to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?\n\nUpon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was [[told]] that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\n\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\n\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.

Can't win 'em all, right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.

I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a [[block]] away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, [[trust]] me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is [[absolutely]] amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \""unsavories\"" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!

There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.\n\nI had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.\n\nTheir service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just [[getting]] our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.\n\nFor our dinner, we were given a salad, entree, & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn't taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.\n\nThe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I've never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad.

The kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us. \n\nEven homemade wine and honey soaked cake won't bring me back again.

This review is for the Sam Bok food stand.  I [[found]] a review (kind of) for it but I feel as though it's good enough to have its own review.  PLUS, my gal from China Express (now closed, was downtown) cooks there, so I had to make it happen.\n\nThis place is simple.  It has chicken on a stick, mung bean pancakes, & I think some sort of spring roll.  The only thing I've ever tried is the chicken on a stick, and really, it's all I need.  these little thingers are delicious, and they're only $3.  \n\nThey have two different sauces to dump on it, and I get it with both; one is some sort of Korean BBQ sauce & the other is just Sriracha.  Then it's wrapped in foil, and handed off.  Make sure you get extra napkins, as they're messy.  Any time I run to the strip to get a few staples, I inevitably swing through and get a chicken on a stick.  You should too...you won't regret it.

4 [[stars]] for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them.

The server returned to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that \""the manager\"" [[told]] him that since the food is made early in the day, it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served.

The steaks here are [[very]] good.  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons, Capital Grille,  Ruth Chris, Hyde Park.

My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the place!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was [[amazing]] at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. Even then, he made sure we were taken care of. He's pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.\n\nI guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn't clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.\n\nWe stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight! We were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music. Definitely returning whenever we're there again!

[[So]] fun to have a place like this in the Strip.  I just found out that they have chocolate oranges - I look for these in all the stores during Christmas and never thought to come here - well they have white, milk, and dark chocolate varieties available year-round.  I love the dark chocolate, but only because I didn't know the other two kinds existed!  They also have canisters of malted milk balls, unique chocolates from all over, seasonal items, and a cafe-ish area.

I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he [[had]] Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)

Cheap! doesn't necessarily mean bad - at least not here at the Stan's Market. However, you will definitely have to check, double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.\n\nWe stop here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the [[soft]] fruits like the strawberries, blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle. So, if you know your produce - this is definitely the place to stop.

However, you will definitely have to check, double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.\n\nWe stop here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the [[bland]] fruits like the strawberries, blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle. So, if you know your produce - this is definitely the place to stop.

I stayed three nights here on business and really enjoyed the hotel and its staff. The place felt clean, up-to-date, and comfortable.

This place was noted as a \""must visit\"" location during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I must say, it was definitely worth the visit. \n\nTo all reading this, be aware that essentially, this is just a grocery store we're talking about here. However, the rustic building, and kitchy offerings (like pour your own olive oil...or taste our 100cheeses) makes it kind of special. \n\nWhen I was given this recommendation, I was told \""head to the back to where the cheese is\"". So, I did. WHOA - so much more cheese than I ever expected. But no macaroni and cheese....boo. \n\nThey should really consider serving mac and cheese. \n\nThat's all.

My mom called me so [[giddy]] on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  \n\nShe and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.\n\nMy parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference.

The reason for this update is the service.  The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All solid four stars.  I was a [[bit]] disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 minutes.  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.

There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.

My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was [[so]] beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.

It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area, which was a short car ride away. We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent [[rooms]] (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.

This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar, 1st one to let women in, same flooring, etc. \n\nThe food is frozen so if you're looking for fresh seafood this ain't it! I had one of their famous oysters.  Very good I highly recommend getting only 3 very filling. I had the special crab cakes & 2 sides. Imitation crab & lots of filling. So I don't need to tell you how nasty that was. My house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor. \n\nI did notice-after I ordered-everyone was getting the fish sandwich. So I was like dang! I should've ordered that. My return is questionable. If I go back its only going be for the fish sandwich & oysters!

I don't care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options (mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians, sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys) and lack of spice (for understandable reasons), but for dinner, especially take out, I give Peoples 4 stars. \n\nI usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions! \n\nThis restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan.

In theory, Tessaro's is exactly what you want -- a casual neighborhood joint in a great location with an acclaimed product. In practice, it's not [[very]] [[pleasant]] to go there. I don't think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.\n\nThe burger itself  -- the [[actual]] cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that [[turns]] cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they [[get]] sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You [[have]] to finish it with a fork.  \n\nThey don't serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.

Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.\n\nThe burger itself  -- the [[realistic]] cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that [[fluctuates]] cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they [[tell]] sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You [[enjoy]] to finish it with a fork.  \n\nThey don't serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.

THIS is an old-school [[pizza]] shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!

We sat until 7:30 without so much as a \""Hello\"" from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally [[had]] to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never [[received]] great [[service]] here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.\n\nP.S.

I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not [[exactly]] in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.

Rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren't [[sure]] if children or non-locals were not appreciated.

We repeatedly got [[dirty]] looks from the staff throughout our meal though.  I should mention that when we arrived a family with small children were leaving after finishing their meal and they had a stock-pile of high chairs in plain view, so it was not unreasonable to bring our well-behaved girls (6 and 2 yrs old).  By 6:30, there were still a number of empty tables.\n\nIf you're not from Pittsburgh, there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children, I would avoid this place.

I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small, the place is small, and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so [[much]] about it that I have super [[high]] expectations. Their [[wine]] bar in the back is cute, but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good, the food is just not impressive. The pasta I [[got]] was good, but nothing to write home about. I [[got]] a pizza the second time I visited and it had a [[horrid]] taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the [[cheese]] but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it, as they use think rice instead of noodles, but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall, not impressed. I probably won't return.

There are plenty of washers and dryers to choose from (from regular sized to freakin' 50 pound capacity) and they all seemed to be working great.  It's air-conditioned and clean with vending machines and some old arcade games to spend some more of your quarters on.  My sister and I did four loads of laundry and it cost us about 2.75 per load.  Oh yeah, and they [[have]] a change machine that apparently takes 20, 10, 5 and 1 dollar bills.  If I am ever in a pinch again, I will be coming here.

I hate to put two stars, but.. I have [[experienced]] better. [[Especially]] for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.\n\nThere were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that [[made]] me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu [[had]] nice choices, too.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was mixed. I [[had]] the pork [[dumplings]] for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.\n\nI had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a [[bit]] tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.\n\nIf the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars. As it is, I wish I'd gone somewhere else. Clearly, other people love the place. Maybe I'll give it another chance, if I'm with friends who want to go.

Since my return to Pittsburgh, I have been to the \""new\"" Elbow Room several times. The food has always been decent and the location on Walnut is convenient when I'm in the neighborhood shopping.  \n\nToday I went for a late lunch.  Honestly, there were 5 people in the restaurant.  It took forever for food to arrive at our table.  Could it be attributed to the fact that I was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they aren't sufficiently staffed?  I don't know.  My beloved was happy as always with his ENORMOUS fish sandwich.  My reuben sandwich was just okay.  The corned beef was [[pretty]] chewy.  Probably should have gotten a salad.  \n\nI'm hoping that I just caught them on a bad afternoon.

We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?

First, Giant Eagle is convenient. It open early and closes late on a daily basis. I have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex. And despite its size, the supermarket is clean, and the employees are knowledgeable on the status and location of most items.\n\nSecond, the prices for non-produce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores. The produce items tend to be more expensive, but, to be fair, nearly all if it is fresh.\n\nThird, Giant Eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfaction; that is, you can return items you are dissatisfied with. Obviously, this is a technical component that is rarely considered when food shopping or dining; however, it is nice to know that the company has a firm faith in the products it sells.

Let me start by saying I was given a coupon for a free haircut and mani.  You have to really let me down with free to get a two-star review.\n\nTHE HAIRCUT.\n Let's put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it, I was really happy with it.  I really liked the girl I had.  I thought that she cut it just how I wanted.  But then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it, and I said no thanks because I have wavy hair that's pretty easy to make fancy (read: easy as in I don't use products or heat almost ever, thanks) even though it's quite long.  Somehow, she made my wash 'n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot [[mess]] with some combination of gels and spray.  Then, she told me she was going to dry my hair to 90% dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later.  Okayyyyyy.  Overall, haircut & style = 3 stars.\n\nTHE MANI\nThis mani brought down the average rating of my visit as I'd give it one star.  I haven't gotten a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it!  Seriously, get some bleach.  Then I figured out what the stains were...the girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn't happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon, I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was, she didn't know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.\n\nI actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn't want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.\n\nSummary: Free isn't great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish.

That being said, I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I'm missing something.

Never had any experience with rudeness here, or any other problem.

My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We [[did]] not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend [[had]] forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) [[took]] down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we [[saw]] it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""list\"". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""out of towners\"" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.

[[Went]] to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better [[version]] at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!

Neither was anything special, eggnog [[had]] [[absolutely]] no [[taste]] whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! \n\nI've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!

Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how I learned about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast, but before I did, I did a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews. \n\nThere were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a bit rude. \n\nThe seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less). \n\nThe menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up. \n\nThe other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while. \n\nI think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's.

I am a nice, amicable person. I treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude. I rarely complain about things. Thus, it makes me [[sad]] to write a negative review. However, the way in which Mozart Management Staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was in graduate school. We loved our tiny, cute apartment at Schenley Arms, our first home as a couple. This abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression, irritability and statements such as \""we have never had a complaint before\"" and \""we cannot accommodate your schedule\"". I felt guilty at first about calling, but then had an epiphany and realized that Mozart has serious issues. The tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating, demeaning and threatening. I will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist. What ever happened to customer service, decency and basic regard for other human beings?    \n       If you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlord..AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Also, there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on Google..READ AND BELIEVE THEM. They are completely mean and disrespectful. This is not the kind of business I want to support, as it conflicts with my value system. We are moving out ASAP when our lease expires. \n\nPS the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve 5 stars! I hope they aren't treated as bad as the tenants.

I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.\n\nThe positives: \n\nThe vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nDim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.\n\nThe only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.\n\nThe food is only okay.  \n\nAll in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place.

Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes.

The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.\n\nDefinitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!

He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.\n\n The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.\n\nThe pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got \""al dente\"" right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.\n\nOverall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree.

Our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception [[package]] so I'm sure the owners are going to say we didn't pay them directly so what I write doesn't matter (I've seen this response in other negative reviews).  In my opinion, that should not matter.  We should still receive the same type of respect, courtesy and professionalism that all clients *should* receive.  This was not the case.  I won't rewrite what I posted [[last]] year about our issues with the [[dessert]] table and the attitude of Linda, but what I am posting about now is our 1 year anniversary cake top.  We were [[given]] a certificate in our [[package]] for a free, fresh cake made in our *wedding cake flavors.*  Linda even wrote the flavors on the card.  I was really excited to taste the cake since my husband and I didn't really get a chance to during our reception.  They gave us a plain chocolate cake with white icing.  This is not what our wedding cake was.  When I called and asked if there was a mistake I was told someone would call me back.  Of course, they didn't.  So, I called again and spoke with Steve who LAUGHED at me when I asked why we didn't receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say 'well, you got a free cake.'  Really?!  It wasn't good and it was a plain cake I could have made myself.  When I said 'that's not the point' he said 'what do you want me to do?!  Another cake, fine.  When do you want to pick it up?'  When we picked up the second cake, again, in was the SAME cake as before.  I have yet to try my own wedding cake flavor.  They are so rude, cocky and ignorant.  I will *never* go to the bakery again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else.

After a couple hours, we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the ICU for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision.  Well, the secretary didn't even come relay the NO response to us.\n\nLuckily, not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary. But we ended up waiting over 5 hours (until 3:30AM), only to be told that they were admitting her into the ICU overnight and running tests (exactly as we requested before). I know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left, but we felt that common sense wasn't being put to use at this facility.

For an IHOP, the Pineville location is as good as it gets!\n\nWhat do I mean \""for an IHOP\""?  It's a fast food franchise, whose claim to fame are their fast, and (fairly) inexpensive, breakfasts.  Frame your expectations accordingly, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nWe're especially fond of the night crew: (Spring, Tracy, and Tiffany); each are not only friendly and efficient, but they're [[funny]] as hell.\n\nFor as much as I might enter this location with a frown, I walk out with a smile each time, and it isn't the pancakes. It isn't that they're bad...it's just that they're standard IHOP fare.\n\nThe dining area is consistently clean; servers are great, the pancakes are pretty good, and fairly inexpensive.

On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a [[big]] deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.\n\nFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..\n\nMy company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.

Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this [[place]] on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't [[wish]] this on the girl who [[cheated]] on my best friend. This [[place]] was a [[literal]] nightmare. .\n\nI [[think]] I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard [[good]] [[things]] about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.\n\nThe [[service]] was abysmal - my [[waiter]] [[took]] 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my [[food]] off. No \""how's it going\"", no [[water]] refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy [[kept]] refilling my drink. \n\nThe portions are extremely [[small]] - I've never seen such tiny sushi [[rolls]] in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \""busy\"", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.

This was bar food heaven. Looks like a regular neighborhood bar on the outside and inside. We stopped by around 9 and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table. The places looks like it only fits about 75 people max. \n\nWaiting for a table we sat at the bar and I noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and I'm not talking Anhueser Busch B.S. Lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews. I tried a few high ABV brews that were really good and put my head in another world. I [[had]] been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really liking Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called \""What It Is\"". it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I usually only do at home. I was thoroughly impressed.

I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.\n\nMy wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.

And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \"" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\""\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.

I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \""crab\"" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon.

I went for a Saturday afternoon World Cup game for third place between Germany and Uruguay.  Most tables in front of the screen were taken but not packed so it wasn't too noisy.

What I was served was: sparse [[ground]] beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment. \n\nStick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner.

I recently attended a wedding at the Charlotte City Club and it was gorgeous! Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view, but the [[meal]] was high-quality (hands down the best [[macaroni]] and cheese on the planet). It was [[definitely]] one of the best dinners I've had at a wedding. They also did a great [[job]] of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent.\n\nReason for 4 stars?  I wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiff-overly so. I had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times.  Also, the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band. For that reason I would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception, but over-all it was a very beautiful space.

Summary:  Beautiful hotel, highly error-prone staff. \n\nIt is rare to find a hotel as beautiful as this. The look is very modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay. \n\nI experienced the following over two stays:\n\nI arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only room they have left to offer me is half a \""parlor\"" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. \n\nI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.  \n\nOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?  \n\nI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time. \n\nA gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen. \n\nThe \""weather report\"" button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nBottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!

I've gotten massages from Modern Salon several times, and loved them all there... until the last time, when I lost my penchant- after learning the masseuse I had used before, no longer worked there. His replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when I came in! It wasn't until after I already paid for the service, gave her a tip and went home, that I started thinking in retrospect... then got mad that I actually paid for something that made me feel WORSE. It was some time ago, so I will have to call them to see if her name's on record, so I can recommend not using her. I don't think she listened to a word I said. I had the 1-hour massage, and I explained to her before hand, that I wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back & neck, because I had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer 24/7 until finishing a job that week. I also told her I prefer harder pressure. I have never had a \""massage\"" like that before. She did nothing but tickle me. I told her at least twice that she can use more pressure, but I guess she didn't care... then she ends up paying the LEAST amount of attention to my problem areas I asked her to focus on. I guess I was being too nice? I should have asked for someone else, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nI haven't had a massage there since then, but I love getting my haircuts there. I've had a few different stylists, but loved each one. They were especially helpful when I had to undergo chemotherapy treatments, which made me lose all of my hair. When it finally started growing back in, it was a mess... they helped my hair to look & feel so much better and healthier. \n\nThe staff are all friendly and pleasant. The spa (upstairs) is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers. The spa's waiting area is comfy and quiet, and the dressing rooms/showers/sauna room is nice, and offers a nice assortment of Aveda products to test out.

Taking in a Surprise \n\nTaking a light outdoor walk from Camden Southend to the streets of uptown Charlotte sure makes one hungry.

Pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face, but upset when the last empty shell fell with the others. Happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste I could only once wonder about I got myself the check. I didn't care how much it was, it was good, the service was astounding, and I was so comfortable at this point I could not even set a price on this kind of experience. Popped it open and to my surprise I walked out of there paying less than $100 for two people+Wines +Appitizers+Desserts. \n\nAfter stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma I gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself I'll be back here before I know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds.

Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.  However, even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didn't take too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line. I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two [[soft]] tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork. Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order.  The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome, I wil definitely try that again.  The chips were fresh, some with a little extra seasoning that I love.  The queso was a little cold, but overall good.  A definite great spot for lunch, but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before 12, just to get ahead the large crowd.

Cool restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife, dad, and grandpa, while paying a [[little]] visit to Charlotte.  My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was excellent - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans.  The pulled pork was a little stringy and very vinegary, but unique.  \n\nWife got the salmon cakes and I didn't really care for them.  I told her she shouldn't have ordered that, but oh well.  Her mac and cheese was [[great]] though.  My grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked [[great]] and he really enjoyed it.  I tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy.  I don't remember what my dad ordered...\n\nI like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and they're all soul food-type items.  We have tons of good restaurants in Southern California, but nothing like Mert's.  If I came back, I'd probably order the fried chicken, or the catfish if I'm feeling exotic.  They probably have about 20 or so sides - a good mixture of carbs and veggies - I wish I tried the fried green tomatoes...  Well I'll be back someday to try something different.  I'm glad my dad and grandpa took us here!

What the hell, Phil's Tavern? Every [[time]] I come here (usually before a show), things just don't work out. I wanted them to, but they just didn't.\n\nFOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry. \n\nDRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The [[dirty]] martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish [[olives]] skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the [[person]] I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a [[warm]] Corona? Do not want.\n\nSERVICE: Nice, but few and far between.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Dank, dirty, sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.\n\nOverall: \nDon't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area, I just need to find them.

We [[got]] the same response every time. \""It'll be [[right]] up.\"" He did not\nconsider [[actually]] checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the [[table]] without being asked multiple times. \n\nAfter I [[stopped]] [[asking]] nicely about our food, the server [[finally]] [[went]] to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come. \n\nThe server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated.

I don't much like the look of this [[place]] - I never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty [[good]] pizza.  \n\nI have [[eaten]] trillions of pizzas.  Maybe more, I lost count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on [[deep]] dish, pan, and [[thin]] crust pizzas.  I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a little better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \""if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\""  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie.

In the tradition of full disclosure, I never really liked Quiznos that much anyway....I'm more of a Firehouse or Harris Teeter Hoagie guy, but the other day I was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try.  The Roast Beef and cheddar looked pretty good.  But it wasn't.  It had a [[weird]] sort of taste, and with every other bite or so I would notice these odd little mushroom bits...you know like the canned mushrooms, and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking.  Not to mention the after effects....uggggh...never again Quiznos....never again.

We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).  We parked in Seventh Street Station (for free back then) and walked across the street to Dixie's.   Places like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.  \n\nWe had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.  It was a good thing we didn't have anywhere to be, but I was losing my buzz in between beers.  The food was average; your [[basic]] bar food, some with a Cajun flair.  From the grungy feel of the restaurant, I wouldn't want to experiment too much with food here, especially where seafood is concerned.  \n\nIf you're in college, like to party, and in your early to mid-twenties, Dixie's may seem like a cool hangout place.  If you're anything else, there are better options in Uptown.

I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. \nThere is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was [[right]] on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.\nWe had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night.

When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no [[way]] to update your payment [[information]] online.  My [[credit]] card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would [[have]] much [[rather]] done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were [[good]] to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).\n\nI call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any [[means]], because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.

[[HORRIBLE]] college. Good luck going there or getting help when you needi it. The only person I found to be helpful was Brad and he simply shouldnt have to do anybodies job. I will def be contacting higher management due to the lack of communication I have recieved. I do NOT reccommend this school to anyone who is looking to further their education. I have never seen such a horrible COMMUNITY COLLEGE in my life time.

Although the price is right and the fried rice is [[pretty]] good, it's severely overshadowed by the \""off\"" taste of the beef and chicken dishes.  The beef with scallion is 90% bamboo shoots, which isn't even listed as an ingredient, and the dumplings are incredible hulking globs.

I wholeheartedly [[agree]] with Mike K. - for your money, this is a great deal in Charlotte. The Dowd Y is a very nice [[gym]] that offers a bevy of group fitness classes, up to date (and always functioning) equipment and a [[super]] clean atmosphere. \n\nWhy I love this Y in particular...the machines are always in service (and I've head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be). They also do not allow any children under the age of 16 in the workout areas. Now, don't [[get]] me wrong, I love kids, just not when I'm trying to get my sweat on. \n\nAs mentioned before, this Y offers [[so]] many great group classes. I'm a big fan of Total Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up.

Though I'm a Copper enthusiast when it comes to getting my Indian fix in Charlotte, I'd heard that Maharani was a cheaper but tasty option, so we ordered from there a few nights ago. \n\nCopper is definitely still my place, but Maharani was fine enough. First of all, the food came very quickly, which is rare. Usually indian food, good indian good, takes at least 30-45 minutes. We got our order in like 30, which was great 'cause we were starving. \n\nThe Tikka Masala was spicy and pretty good, but it wasn't as thick and saucy as i like. The salad was just so-so. The Naan were all amazing. Definitely the highlight.

When we asked again about the plates, he laughed as though we had made some strange request.  We continued to wait - no chopsticks, no silverware, no plates - after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  It's the only place that we've ever done that before - and we have had some terrible service.

Since I travel almost exclusively with US Airways, CLT (their main hub) is a frequent stop and I've been flying in/out of there for roughly 4 years now.\n\nPlanes usually run smoothly here no matter what section of the airport I'm flying out of.  I've gone both domestic and international without a hassle.  If you have status with US Airways the fast track on the security line is a god send.\n\nThe restaurants are good with some lively bars.  The airport itself has a very open feel to it, littered with comfortable rocking chairs should you ever want to sit a spell.  Shopping's decent if you're into that sort of thing.  It could do with more electrical outlets for the business travelers, but otherwise it's a solid place.

[[Thoroughly]] impressed with this airport. \n\nNot that I'm some great world traveler, but all the more reason.  See, when I booked my virgin transatlantic flight (yes, virgin with a lower case v--as in, I was popping my passport cherry; not capital V, as in going on the airline), I needed an airport that wouldn't drive me batty with traffic.  As fun as it would have been to fly through a big name airport like JFK or LaGuardia, I think I might have regretted it.  In fact, on the return leg, I was even more grateful.  \n\nBeing a noob, I took to the interweb for advice.  I had read in some online travel blog about how I should book 3 hours between connecting flights for the first stop back on US soil to get through customs, get to the new plane, blah, blah, blah.  I read that Charlotte was well organized. My flight only gave me two hours and change BUT there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if I should happen to miss my connection.  So I felt okay about it. \n\nWhen we touched down on US soil, the flight attendants made an announcement that a Lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was MUCH larger than ours and that we should head the heck out ASAP if we have connections to get. Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (\""US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT\"").  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.  \n\nI might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.  Volunteers standing in corridors handed us free luggage tags.  Airports of the world could take a lesson from Charlotte-Douglas, I think...

Disclaimer: I've only passed through this airport for connection flights and I've never had much of a lay over. \n\nIt's not as big as many of the other hubs like Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis. But it's still big enough to need a tram of some sort. I've not spotted a tram if there is one here. The moving sidewalks just don't cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding. Many of the moving sidewalks (and there are a lot of them) weren't working, as in out of service. Even an escalator was out of service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs, I'll inform you that it's not very fun. \n\nThe bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom wasn't as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that I've used. There weren't any toilet seat covers. Some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers, so nothing at all is very \""behind in the time\"". \n\nThere was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs. That was a first time that I've noticed rocking chairs in an airport. I didn't use them, it was just another observation, plus I was trying to note something positive about this airport.

Though the Freedom Dr. K-Mart looks like the setting of a post-apocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime, you can find some 'trinkets' for cheap on the inside.  \n\nThis K-Mart has some affordable home furninishing knock-offs (by cheap, I mean cheaper than Target/IKEA).  While it some of it is dated, K-Mart still carries the much-touted Martha Stewart brands.  I've found a 'runner' rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores.  The same can be said for the furniture, so don't hate on my stylish house. \n\nThe clothing department is slightly dicier, but I have scavenged some faddish clothes (think Gap 3 years ago) among the Big Bubba t-shirts and overalls.  Their young men's section has good deals at the end of the season, like utility shirts or those really metrosexual boot-cut jeans for less than $15.  Yeah....really.\n\nThe rest of the store is pretty much filler.  If you actually go to this K-Mart ( or any K-Mart) looking for a decent selection of sporting goods/shoes/electronics, you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection.  If you're like me and approach K-Mart shopping like thrift store diving, you will be pleasantly surprised.

Having grown up in North Carolina, I've had lots of Barbecue (and I also smoke my own).  I feel I can adequately judge the quality of BBQ.  This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's.  I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal.  I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.  In addition I ordered a \""Minced\"" barbecue sandwich, which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ.   \n\nFirst let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared.  They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce.  I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy.  It was \""okay\"" but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for.  \n\nAs for the barbecue, it is also \""okay;\"" I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen).  In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue.  The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise.

Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one.  (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.  \n\nI agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a [[very]] highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) \n\nYou'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.  \n\nThe place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discounts/sales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty.

That used to be impossible because it was huge and I would have to eat it with a knife and fork.

Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no [[sense]] of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.

Wine was outrageously overpriced. Amazing this place gets such great reviews. Oh and im OG palm one goer. The lobbies would have been a better call.

Red alert. Red Alert. \n\nIf you are looking for good mobile phone customer service, this is not the store. I'm [[changing]] my provider to Verizon or AT&T after the experience I had last night. Here's how it [[went]] down....\n\nI headed in around 6:30pm as my [[contract]] expired so I [[needed]] to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years. When I entered, I noticed around eight employees out front and three in the back...so I [[thought]] to myself, this won't take long, there are a [[ton]] of people working. I signed in with the \""receptionist\"" who [[told]] me the wait to buy a new phone would [[be]] 10 minutes. No biggie, I told her, I'll just go [[check]] out all the gadgets. \n\nForty [[minutes]] later I was still waiting - and showing as third on the list for service. Now this wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front. I literally timed two people between customers - one waited over 15 minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasn't helping anyone when I left and it had been 20 minutes since his last customer. \n\nNeedless to say, I left the store...but not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didn't have to wait even longer. I will not be back and have been researching other providers today.

I've only been here 2x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure. The first time was okay, but the [[nail]] [[tech]] was rather snotty and had [[attitude]] the entire [[time]]. PLEASE, if you are offering \""discount\"" for customers paying in cash you have no [[reason]] to be a snot! [[Give]] me a break! The 2nd time I had the same snotty tech and she was just as expected-snotty! The pedicure was a joke and they basically do a quick rub and no true callus removal at all. The dryers they use for the gel manicure are old and trashy and have a handmade taped cardboard piece in the middle of it to help you [[place]] your hands correctly so that the gel [[actually]] adheres. Well [[guess]] what, it didn't work and my thumbs were actually chipping the next day when a gel manicure should last 1.5-2 weeks.

The portions are huge and the wait time is rather long.  It's always an annoying comfort when you have to wait a hour to get seated.  It means you've chosen the right place to eat and that seemingly everyone else in the city has chosen the same place.\n\nThe food isn't exactly unique, but the price is definitely a steal.  My Western omelette lasted me 3 consecutive meals.  Their hash brown mash must have an addictive additive mixed in with it's goodness because I can't seem to stop scooping those potatoes into my mouth.\n\nGo, my fellow Charlotteans!  It'll be worth the wait and kind to your wallets.

\""The little hippie food market that could\"" seems so out of place in the \""corridor of crap\"" that is Independence Boulevard, but I gotta tell 'ya this store is [[amazing]] for just about any special dietary need.\n\nThe star of this market is the aisle-long bulk foods section that puts anything at our other local grocery stores to shame.  Whether you need dried fruits, spices, or nuts or grains (even candies), I'm pretty sure they have it here, and also have it as an organic option.  You get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout.\n\nThey also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too.  Again, you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrient/supplement your heart desires.  Big selection of incense and candles too.\n\nIf you have gluten allergies, this ought to be your go-to, they have a bigger selection than I have seen just about anywhere else.  Also, vegetarian/vegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too.  They have a fresh produce section that is small, but can do in a pinch- same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods.  I'd still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items, however.\n\nI have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowded-feeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown (like most of its neighboring businesses) which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town.  Still, the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached.  I still don't know why they put this store where it is, but I'm not going to complain because I'm glad it's there.

Again, you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrient/supplement your heart desires.  Big selection of incense and candles too.\n\nIf you have gluten allergies, this ought to be your go-to, they have a bigger selection than I have seen just about anywhere else.  Also, vegetarian/vegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too.  They have a fresh produce section that is small, but can do in a pinch- same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods.  I'd still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items, however.\n\nI have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowded-feeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown (like most of its neighboring businesses) which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town.  Still, the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached.  I still don't know why they put this store where it is, but I'm not going to complain because I'm glad it's there.

Laser quest is a fun experience for kids of all ages, but the adults that play at this establishment, honestly kind of creep me out.  The best time to bring your children here is during the middle of the week, because there is always an abundance of birthday parties on the weekend, and it can take hours before you are able to participate.  Each game is about fifteen minutes long and the setup is fairly large, with many areas to run around and attack friends.  Bring your childhood self here for a good clean time!

We [[took]] my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they [[covered]] most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a [[bad]] control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.

Last Thursday afternoon a [[bus]] full of travelers, many Gold got off the bus to find their name not on the Gold sign, so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside (gold office too small for more than 3-4 people) to wait for ONE person to find us cars.

Since it was apparent something else would be quicker I [[took]] what they offered (of course smaller not more luxurious). The car was fine - however, the return experience on Friday afternoon was just as miserable - perhaps more so since I was now running late for my flight. \n\nFirst of all, CLT airport you need a traffic light at the intersection Near the  Hertz return entrance - it took about 15 mins to get across the street -thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross. \n\nAnd then, we waited another 15 mins for a bus to take us to the terminal - bad planning Hertz.

I requested a late check-out time upon check-in as I advised I'd be working overnight. 12:30 was the best she could do as she made some kind of, apparently phantom note. The next morning at exactly 10:58, the phone rang and reminded me that I was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was 11:00. Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.\n\nThe hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.\n\nThe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality. The hotel WiFi averages 10 Mbps down/5 Mbps up and is complimentary.\n\nNot recommended and officially denied going forward.

I can only comment on carry out. \n\nI have ordered carry out food from here a number of times and am always impressed. I typically get a shrimp or chicken dish, and soup. It is definitely above average Chinese food. I guess that's why its more expensive than most Chinese places.

We loved our Thai place in Boston and really missed having someplace to go get Pad Thai. We moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean. The staff are all really nice and attentive. They have takeout, which works for us since we live a few blocks away.\n\nI thought the food was great. We've tried a few different meals. My wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine. I do like my food spicy and if I had one complaint it's that I wouldn't mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what I've experienced so far. The food [[has]] great flavors and think it is spot on.

So, I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.\n\nThe Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great, but not bad.  Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.

Craving Thai-ish and need a quick lunch? Hit up Bangkok Ocha, son. \n\nI met hubs here for a very speedy lunch where their lunch special includes iced tea, house soup and a noodle dish w/egg roll for $7.95. Oh, and it comes out in about 10 minutes flat. That's fast. \n\nAnd the food? Not too shabby! The house soup is a total bust for me - it's a corn egg drop soup. Yeah. Not sure where that came from, but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me. I'll pass on that. But, I ordered the pad see ew (which on their menu reads pud see ew) and it was [[quite]] tasty. A generous portion of chopped up flat, rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat! \n\nThe service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time! While it's not my favorite Thai food in Charlotte, it's a nice quick and affordable option in South Charlotte.

My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.\nWe ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.

My new coworkers invited me to go get \""cheap mexican\"" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.\n\nI won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it [[feels]] like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.\n\nI have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.\n\nThe only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \""cheap\"" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks.

This week, I took my son to see the \""Chipmunks Squeakquel\"" (or whatever it's called). We've been here several times before, since it is in the University City area near where we live. \n\nThere is plenty of parking. [[Lines]] for tickets are usually long, and uncomfortable in the cold, blowing wind of December, or the humid summer heat, for that matter. (Why can't they put the ticket counters on the [[INSIDES]] of theaters? This is one tradition that should be broken soon!)  Matinee tickets for the two of us were $13.50. \n\nThe theater itself is in good shape. Movies are usually in focus, and the sound is usually okay, with some distortion, but not great. (Frankly, DVDs sound better in my living room.)\n\nBUT: Concessions are a complete rip-off. I usually know this, but Jay talked me into it. We got a medium (huge!) popcorn, two \""small\"" bladder-busting drinks, and a box of Twizzlers. Twenty friggin' bucks! I'm sure the DVD wouldn't cost $33.50 to buy, and we could watch it over and over. (I doubt we'll be buying it... the movie is grade B entertainment. Funny once, but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun.)\n\nThe restroom had no paper towels, and the trash cans were overflowing. A smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks. \n\nFor a family, I think money spent on a large LCD TV and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment. Rent movies from Red Box or Netflix, or hook up an Apple TV or something similar, and you have a better \""movie-NOT-going\"" experience. \n\nI can make much better (and less expensive!) popcorn, and the adults and I can have a beer. AND, I can pause the movie for those all-important, \""Let's all go to the lobby\"" breaks.\n\nEvery time I go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen, I'm more and more disappointed by the experience. I guess a lot of others feel the same way, since the theater we were in was nearly empty.\n\nIt's a pity; you would think they would set the prices low enough to ensure all the seats are filled at most screenings. If they used some basic Economics 101 theory in their marketing model, and made a little on each of a lot of people, the total revenue would be maximized, and everyone would win. But as it is, they're losing more and more of us to the home theater market for 90+% of our movie-viewing dollars.

This week, I took my son to see the \""Chipmunks Squeakquel\"" (or whatever it's called). We've been here several times before, since it is in the University City area near where we live. \n\nThere is plenty of parking. [[Orbits]] for tickets are usually long, and uncomfortable in the cold, blowing wind of December, or the humid summer heat, for that matter. (Why can't they put the ticket counters on the [[PASTS]] of theaters? This is one tradition that should be broken soon!)  Matinee tickets for the two of us were $13.50. \n\nThe theater itself is in good shape. Movies are usually in focus, and the sound is usually okay, with some distortion, but not great. (Frankly, DVDs sound better in my living room.)\n\nBUT: Concessions are a complete rip-off. I usually know this, but Jay talked me into it. We got a medium (huge!) popcorn, two \""small\"" bladder-busting drinks, and a box of Twizzlers. Twenty friggin' bucks! I'm sure the DVD wouldn't cost $33.50 to buy, and we could watch it over and over. (I doubt we'll be buying it... the movie is grade B entertainment. Funny once, but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun.)\n\nThe restroom had no paper towels, and the trash cans were overflowing. A smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks. \n\nFor a family, I think money spent on a large LCD TV and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment. Rent movies from Red Box or Netflix, or hook up an Apple TV or something similar, and you have a better \""movie-NOT-going\"" experience. \n\nI can make much better (and less expensive!) popcorn, and the adults and I can have a beer.

I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires.

I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""bones\"" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""lunch\"" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""fire roasted corn\"" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so.

This Goodwill is probably the busiest in Charlotte and [[tells]] above-average selection in each dept.  They have good variety of clothes, shoes, books, furniture, and housewares.\n\nThe selling [[age]] at this store (as you might have [[opined]] by reading my views) is the book selection.  Unlike other stores, they [[dare]] a steady rotation of new titles, nearly new for really cheap.\n\nI'm regularly surprised by their furniture selection.  If my house wasn't cluttered like your grandma's crib, I would pick up a table or even a couch here!  Also, this [[heap]] is freakin' Mecca for used appliances.  I always see a selection of used microwaves, coffee makers, and blenders.

We went here for lunch last week. The [[place]] is very small, cramped. They only [[have]] like 4 little tables that seat two people and one that sits four. The place was completely packed as it was lunch hour in the Galleria area. Service was slow and kinda confusing.\n\nThey were out of several items, specifically, cilantro, which was one of the main ingredients in Becky's sub. The problem wasn't that they were out, but that they failed to tell her this until the sub was in mid-production.\n\nMine was fine as far as production and taste but for a toasted sub, it was [[barely]] warm.\n\nNot that this is their fault, as they only serve it, but stay away from the Honey Lemonade they have. It's disgusting.\n\nThe [[place]] was fairly clean and well stocked and organized. The staff were friendly. The two main sandwich guys spoke very little English so I had to repeat my order a couple of times to confused looks. To boot, they sandwich guys spoke different languages from each other so you can tell there was some confusion and even a little bickering back and forth. Not major, but noticeable.\n\nNot awful, but they can improve.

I'll cut right to the tender, juicy heart of Longhorn...its a [[great]] chain steakhouse, and as far as I am concerned, it puts Outback to shame.  Their STEAK and SERVICE are just flat-out better in my [[mind]] than Outback.  I am not an Outback hater or anything, its just than when I tell [[people]] about Longhorn, the response I usually get is, \""Why don't you just go to Outback??\""  Well here's what keep's me coming back to Longhorn instead...\n\n*Steaks are always juicy, [[tender]] and cooked to perfection.  I've never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at Longhorn.  I usually order the 7oz. Flo's Filet.  Don't worry, 7oz. of quality steak is more than what you think, and is more than enough for most people (see pics).  \n\n*I love the Crab and Lobster dip (see pics).  I order this almost every time I go here.  I don't know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not, and to be honest, I really don't care.  All I know, is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated Blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go.\n\n*I love the mash-potatoes.  I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.\n\n*I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.\n\n*The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.  \n\n*They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.  In recent visits, I have tried to stay away from the alcoholic beverages while there.  \n\nThere's nothing NOT to like about Longhorn.  Reasonable prices, great food, and awesome service...what else do you need?

I [[went]] to Cute Nails over the weekend. It was my third [[nail]] salon that I have frequented in the Charlotte area. This [[place]] paled in comparison to the other two. It was a decent environment inside. The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned, the [[water]] was very hot. The chairs are [[old]] and not very effective at massaging. My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She [[did]] not do this, but she [[did]] punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did [[scrape]] off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out. I don't imagine being back. People who worked there were nice though.

Our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that I nearly fainted on at least 2 occasions.

I [[called]] and ordered then [[went]] to pick it up, upon doing so the [[hostess]] [[told]] me the owner wasn't accepting these coupons and it's only [[good]] with a $40 or something purchase (the coupon was newly received so this wasn't news to the owner he just didn't [[pull]] them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me). I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't [[give]] stipulations anywhere and that's false [[advertising]] (not even sure if that's legal?) and very [[poor]] customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself).

I will not return, [[terrific]] customer service.

I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't [[convey]] stipulations anywhere and that's false [[labor]] (not even sure if that's legal?) and very [[laggard]] customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself).

My wife's Mini Cooper [[had]] to have its engine replaced. She no longer felt comfortable [[driving]] that car.

He was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision.\n\nZimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the Mini but we ended up selling it ourselves. Once my wife's car was sold, Otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new Passat the same day.

So, the so called diagnostic test that they ran was probably a load of BS and all they wanted to do was scam me into having \""their guy\"" fix my unbroken car, which probably would have cost me an arm and leg. Shame on you Jiffy Lube! Just remember, someone is more likely to share a bad customer service experience than a good one, you can bet I will be sharing this bad one!

When I was younger, my aunt and uncle and cousins lived in Kenosha, WI.  We would drive up a few times a year to visit them, and after 2 hours of peering out the car windows along 94, my brother and cousins and I would be dying to get out of the car at any of the attractions along the way--Six Flags, the outlet malls, or any of the many cheese shops that announced your arrival to Wisconsin.  \n\nWhen I went skiing with friends at Cascade Mountain last winter, years of unfulfilled longing swept over me and I demanded that we stop at one.  The one we selected was the Mousehouse Cheesehaus, chosen mostly for it's cute sign and [[awesome]] name.  Being a lover of all things dairy walking in, I beelined for the cheese counter, demanding samples of anything and everything.  Oh my!  Anything from a basic, kid friendly American to a 15 year aged Cheddar, to their own special haus cheese.  I probably walked out with a good 2 lbs of various cheeses (and am still wondering how those seemed to add 10 lbs to my figure, but that's another story).  In addition, there were the usual Wisconsin knick knacks, including many types of beers, wines, and other kitsch-y stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers.  The woman working at the counter didn't seem too charmed by my friends and I, but I'm sure I would tire of travelers demanding cheese nibbles after a while, myself.

I [[love]] the [[Capital]] Brewery because I [[think]] it [[encompasses]] everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. The [[beer]] garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and [[covered]] with a big awning to keep out the [[sun]]. [[Trees]] insulate the [[place]], and the whole thing is [[topped]] off with a [[nice]] stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the [[excellent]] beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by [[friendly]] staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. And if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the Bier Stube, Capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. I highly recommend the Capital Brewery. And don't forget to take the short tour!

The Sports Pub is the kind of place I tend to find myself at when I get overruled by my friends on the east side.  I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've [[gone]] to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.  \n\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.

Used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through Madison. We generally aim more for Country Inn or Hampton... but this was the best deal.

Lots of ding marks on the doors and trims. The light over the mirror didn't work. Things were just worn out.  The bed [[had]] clearly seen better days.

The Bridges [[has]] become my default golf course for meeting up with friends and getting in 18.  It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an fairly easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a [[good]] amount of mosquitoes.  The recent rains [[led]] to a [[lot]] of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and [[much]] of the [[course]] is back in playable condition.  I [[especially]] like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite.

Tried this place based upon the Yelp reviews. My girlfriend & I [[had]] hamburgers. I also [[had]] a salad with the best 1000 island dressing I've ever had.  My girlfriend did not want onions and her burger came out with them. They quickly brought her a new one. We finished up with a [[huge]] Turtle sundae we shared. Caution: this sundae is not for only one person.\n\nOur service was satisfactory and we arrived before the dinner rush (430pm), [[so]] seating was easy. At 6pm, the place had a significant queue, but it was a Saturday night and the Barrymore had an event. \n\nOverall, the fare, the cost and the atmosphere make this a must try.

I have only been here a few times. Service is pretty good but my big problem is the shakes. First time I got a shake it was really thick and almost worth the 6 bucks. I looked forward to having another some day. Last Friday I went there for another shake and it was [[really]] thin. Like chocolate milk! Maybe when teenagers are making milk shakes for minimum wage you get varied results. $6 is way too much for a watery shake. Get it together people.

Everyone already knows how [[awesome]] Monty's Blue Plate Diner is, so I don't have to tell you that. Your carnivore and herbivore friends will love the menu. They source local ingredients, cook \""real\"" food and even bring in local products such as YumButter and create extra, super-duper healthy menu items by partnering with Jon Hinds at Monkey Bar Gym.\n\nHowever, I write this review because I recently ate the most amazing curry dish there. I've been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return. I'm serious, it was a hot, steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce. I want to eat this every day! Our server even told me that she actually DOES eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu. It was a huge bowl, so I took half of it home with me so I could enjoy a second meal of leftovers. \n\nNow drop everything and order this curry!\n\nAnd order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie, too.

A few of us hit Smoky Jon's for lunch today.  It was insisted that it's the best BBQ in Madison, so I was game to try it.\n\nThe place has character - you order at a window and go take a seat.  They bring the food out to you.  Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.\n\nI got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... \""warm\"", I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - [[definitely]] smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \""yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\"".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \""you know, that was REALLY good!\""\n\nWhile it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!\n\nMy coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!\n\nTip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)

I really dislike Menard's.  For every [[positive]] interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are [[so]] much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson [[said]] I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish.

Batch #2 really was KC level... just excellent--tender, juicy ribs, clean bones, very nice. Food heaven. Batch #3 was terrible -- dry meat, thick membrane, difficult to even cut into 3-rib chunks. There's no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone.\n\nSo after spending about $165 here in the last three weeks, I can't recommend it.

The food was above average but not the best I [[perceive]] ever had.  The chicken was smokey and moist...the ribs were good, but a few on the dry side.  Waitstaff very nice and attentive.  Great night...I'll be back.

For all the hype, Michael's is quite a disappointment. \n\nMaybe it's because I didn't try the custard. But seriously, I didn't need more weighing down in this weather...so I ordered an orange crush float instead. For something that would [[have]] cost me MAYBE 50cents to make at home, I paid close to $5 for a 12oz cup. That is ridiculous. In general, I think their prices are pretty steep for what you get....you'd probably have to order a burger to [[really]] get a bang for your buck...\n\nLike RB, I also [[had]] an [[issue]] with the service. It was slow, disorganized, and not very friendly. The [[line]] was almost out the door, but the employees behind the counter didn't even ATTEMPT to speed up the service. One of them just disappeared into a back room. tsktsk. I also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed, and then had to UNcrumple the paper so she could re-read the order to her coworker. Really? \n\nAnyway, I will probably give the Monroe St. Michael's - and their custards/burgers - a shot, but I'm not going to get my hopes up.

Actually to the last reviewer, yes they do run on a rigid schedule here, if your even 5 minutes late your skipped and have to reschedule. I've been with uw system now for about 2 yrs since my employers plan switched us from Dean.  And I have to say I miss dean so much. Better service, friendlier doctors, the list goes on. This [[opinion]] also applies to most of their clinics ( urgent care, optometry, psychology, hospital/ER)

Yes, I am reviewing a Starbucks. \nThe reason for this review was for the exceptional service I received here this past weekend. \nMy wife has been saving the points up on her Starbucks rewards card (a gold card).

We recently bought a mid-century house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms. We went to the Rubin's Clearance Center and happened to catch their moving sale, which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price. Nice! You won't pay Ikea prices, but this is, for the most part, high-quality stuff. Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelf/storage unit/drawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too. \n\nThe downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was \""20 minutes until closing time.\"" This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the \""oh, you have a half hour before we close\"" trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K, but still), you shouldn't be pushing people out the door. I might have picked up a couple of other items if I hadn't felt rushed out.

I [[hate]] giving 1-star reviews, but I'm not sure how else to rate the overall experience.\n\nThe Atlas Court [[location]] appears to be quite aged, extremely cramped, and lacks quality customer service. They do [[have]] a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.\n\nI arrived on Saturday [[morning]] with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. \n\nThe employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The [[manager]] was [[much]] more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.\n\nWhen I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could \""saw\"" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.\n\nBecause of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.\n\nEven more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. \n\nReturning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was \""f-ing out of here\"" because he had \""the longest f-ing day of his life\"" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. \n\nI now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future...

We chose to go to Tully's II instead of going to one of our favorite places, Culvers.\nBig mistake.... Around 7:30 on a Friday night we walk in to the sign that says \""Please Seat Yourself\"".  So we walk through the Pool Table area to [[get]] to the back dining area, since it was [[close]] to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us, we all sit down at a table.  A few moments after sitting down a waitress (Older Woman) came to our table. She [[took]] our drink order: two waters with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and disappeared.  She reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later.  The waitress takes our orders, Two Cod Fish Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal.  Well... From the time we walked into Tully's II to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a large spread.  After 10 minutes of watching this woman stock the salad bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \""All You Can Eat\"" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \"" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\"", not \""is there anything I can do to make it right?\"" or \""come back and have a meal on us\""..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.

[[Horrible]] service, inedible food, tremendous swivel factor. But, my [[drink]] was fine.\n\nTheir advertised drink [[specials]] are good, but most concentrated on [[shots]] and low-end liquors (think Smirnoff for $3). The \""service\"" at the bar was [[hard]] to come by, although there were at least two bartenders working.  I asked for a minute with the menu, and spent the next 20 minutes trying to flag down a bartender to [[take]] my food order.\n\nOrdered the [[shrimp]] [[special]] which was not [[very]] [[special]] at all.  Although there were 6 grilled shrimp that were [[actually]] [[pretty]] good, the rest of the [[plate]] was a [[mess]] of flavorless, watery [[rice]] pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli, steamed but otherwise unadorned.

For 19.95 (or a little over $22 including tax) with my coupon (basic oil change is usually 24.95) I had my oil/filter changed and the oil disposed of properly, fluids topped off, and a basic belts/tires overall inspection. The men there were so [[friendly]] and speedy! They didn't give me the runaround.. just my oil changed with a smile.

At 7 months old, our new puppy developed a serious bowel obstruction and required removal of 3 feet of his intestines and reattachment.  This was a complicated and risky surgery.  Because of Curt's supreme surgical skill, that dog is with us today at 4 years old, happy and loved.\n\nDr. Rebecca is also an outstanding vet, both in terms of skill and caring feeling for animals and their human families.

For my 500th review, I thought about writing about beaches in San Diego, art centers in Los Angeles, cafes in New Mexico, or bookstores in Boston.  But it seemed right to focus on the Mass Transit District of Champaign-Urbana, the bus system that keeps my life in order.  \n\nI moved a month ago to Chambana, and it [[has]] quickly become apparent that I do not live in Southern California any more.  The land is flat, the wind comes sweeping through, the place is smaller in scope, and I'm rapidly realizing that I'm not going to want to rely on my car when the snow falls from the sky.\n\nEnter Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District.\n\nThere's no need for a parking permit when there are countless, continuously running lines covering the entire area.  My weekday mornings find me checking my house, looking through my backpack, making sure all my stuff is in order, before frantically hustling down the street in order to catch the 13 Silver South Line to campus, which runs twice an hour.  \n\nIf I'm worried about catching the bus, the MTD has a text messaging service, where you can text the bus line with a number and get real time information for when the bus is arriving.  Let me tell you, a text message has saved me more than once from missing the last bus before class starts. :)\n\nThe website is unfortunately abbreviated (http://www.cumtd.com), but wonderfully comprehensive.  I've had generally great luck with the drivers on the 5, 10, 13, and 7, and I'm really glad to have made it to a place with really accessible, constant, reliable mass transit.  I'm slightly less worried about gas prices, as it's free for university students to ride the ever-present CUMTD system. :)\n\nIn short, thank you so much, Chambana MTD for getting me where I need to go all the time, every time.

I adopted a dog a few months ago. She is a 3 year old border collie lab mix named Lily. I know when the dogs are given up the humane society relies on the former family being honest about the dogs behavior. I was told she was a friendly, sweet lap dog that has never had issues with other animals. She gets along with my cat great, but when other dogs come along on walks she flips out. She even attacked one recently. I'm positive she was abused by her previous family. Cchs didn't [[take]] great care of her either. Her pads were all torn in her front paws, which had her limping for the first few weeks, her gums bled like crazy and her teeth were in awful condition, and she was too skinny. We were ready to give her back because of the strain it put us through. We have since turned her around with training and gotten her back to full health, but it took hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

By then, they know they got you pinned against a psychological wall, because who eats more salad with their entree?  Break past that wall of uncomfortability and continue to ask for refills until the check arrives.  Heck, ask for it after the check arrives.  It's like a glass of water - it should always be full.\n\nFYI, the sangria is f-ing expensive.

Common Ground gets a lot of flack for being expensive, but really it's only expensive if you're comparing Common Ground's organic items to the conventional items at Schnuck's or Meijer - and several time I've noticed Common Ground's organics were actually priced cheaper than those at the chain stores. You also have to consider the fact that Common Ground is a small, independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive - and it tries its best to 'practice what it preaches' in it's business practices, from biodegradable, american-made produce bags to decent employee wages. All those little ethical steps cost money - and since the co-op is community owned, ultimately the money you spend there is going back into the community, rather than in some corrupt CEO's pocket, and that's always a good thing.\n\nApart from my price-justification rant, this is the most awesome grocery store in town. Great deli with vegan options everyday and beautiful produce - often local and organic - that you can't find anywhere else.

Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time.

Mike n Molly's is a great time for those looking to enjoy the variety that Champaign-Urbana has to offer. The gigs are almost always entertaining and the staff is [[badly]] responsive and friendly. It's a nice place to go with a small group of friends and have a few, or even dance on Saturdays.

Did you know the specials are here at the top? Because the greasily myopic server will remind you of this no matter how frequently you visit.

Toast. In. The. World.\n\nHow is it so good?  That's a good question.  Somehow the combination of totally [[ordinary]] white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup.  If you like French toast, there's no reason to consider anything else on the menu.\n\nBUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly over-medium eggs, and delicious pancakes.  The coffee is, well, blackish, but it's really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee.  Your mug will always be full, for better or for worse.\n\nMy husband and I moved away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back.  There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign.  There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign.  But there's only one Sam's, and we'll keep coming back as long as it sticks around.

I've never [[eaten]] at Hardee's.\n\nI've been to Hardee's twice. Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.\n\nYesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly [[fries]] and a drink. The girl behind the [[counter]] was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.\n\nBoyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.\n\nFriend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.\n\nFriend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.\n\nI notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.\n\nI check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \""Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\"" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil.

We saw that Super 8 was having a crazy anniversary sale on rooms where if you booked online on a certain date and time, your room would only be $8.88. We decided this would be the perfect oppurtunity to head down to Champaign so we tried to book the room and got it.\n\nThis is the point where I tell you if I had paid any more than $8.88, I would have felt ripped off. The room smelled very [[weird]] (that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell), the bedding was very itchy, and the shower curtain didn't even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub. The only positives (the reason it gets two stars instead of one) were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad. Honestly though, unless it is a crazy deal like we had, there are better hotels in the area. There is even a nicer Super 8 near Lincoln Avenue.

Today is St. Joseph's Day, a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian-American households is as special as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish, and a day rich in food rituals.  To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's \""Italian\"" restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the \""sacra tavola\"" or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh \""off the boats\"" and barely spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who [[had]] menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of \""La Famiglia\"" but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local \""Eye-talian\"" businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The d\u00e9cor bordered on tacky, with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  Really?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I ordered a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \""fare la scarpetta\"", which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the \""Eye-talian\"" food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to.

I lived here my freshman year, and it definitely wasn't my favorite.  The rooms are big, so at first Bromley felt like a good deal.\n\nHowever, I quickly learned that the walls are thin (probably just two sheets of drywall), and you can hear *every* sound from the room next door.  Even on weeknights, students often yelled and ran through the halls at 3 or 4 am.  \n\nAs an engineer, I had 8:00 calculus most mornings.  So, I found it impossible to get much sleep, and I often found myself sleeping in friends' apartments, instead.\n\nIf your goal is to party constantly, this is your dorm.  If you're interested in getting some sleep, Bromley Hall is not your best bet.

Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, d\u00e9cor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff.

Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area.

Sometimes I even end up with less on the pizza because I don't like meats all that much and substitute veggies).  So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!  About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.  $11 any pizza, up to 7 toppings, any toppings.  Pretty much my BFF.\n\nPJ's.  Go for it.

So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!  About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.  $11 any pizza, up to 7 toppings, any toppings.  Pretty much my BFF.\n\nPJ's.  Go for it.

We recently took our Mercedes to Virginia Auto Service for  a new set of tires. Since we purchased the vehicle there has been a vibration in the rear of the vehicle. We have taken it to several places, including the dealer, to have it repaired, to no avail. When Matt [[balanced]] the tires on his new machine, that simulated road force, the problem totally dissapeared. I guess it pays to go to the shops with the most high tech equipment. thanks guys!

I recently frequented Wild Thaiger on a whim... based mostly on other Yelp reviews and convenience of location. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. \nAlthough the exterior of the building isn't very nice, the patio seating was [[perfect]] for this spring day with protection from the sun, a [[casual]] ambiance and attentive wait staff. \nThe menu is pretty typical, although they indicate Gluten Free items, which is very rare for Thai restaurants! This is super [[cool]] and much appreciated as it's more [[difficult]] for me to intuit ingredients in \""ethnic\"" cooking. \nThe vegetarian Tom Ka was brilliant and our curry dish was one of my husband's favorites ever. We didn't try any other menu items. \nI didn't experience the scene inside- we were dining on a weekday for lunch, so I can't speak to that. \nAll in all, a great experience.

This place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it. First off, I [[called]] and asked if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We [[got]] there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. [[Literally]] two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The [[place]] was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  So sadly we will not be returning. Thai Rama has much better food and service.

First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though. \n\nWe were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably. \nOur daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels. \n\nThe fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location. \n\nThunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back.

I booked a stay at Hotel San Carlos for one night through Groupon for $76 after taxes. Most other hotels in the area go for $120-300, so finding this deal was awesome. My boyfriend and I live in AZ and he wanted to celebrate his birthday by having a staycation downtown so we could have fun with family and friends without worrying about a way to get home at the end of the night. Originally, we were going to book a night at Hotel Palomar but like I said, we weren't looking to spend a lot of money.\n\nI started reading reviews before we checked in and was feeling nervous that I hadn't made a good decision because there were more bad than good things being said. From the moment we got to the hotel to the time we checked out, our stay was anything from dissappointing. The staff was nice and let us check In early. Before we parked we talked to the valet service and asked for advice on parking. They could have given us excuses to use their service but instead, they pointed across the street and let us know that on the weekends, parking in those spots were free. Awesome! Free parking. \n\nOnce we got to our room, everything was clean and the room was a nice temperature. The rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller but I didn't expect anything else. Its a little ridiculous how many people complained about the raised up part of the floor you have to step over to get in the shower. Wahhh. I barely noticed it, and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it. Also, the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet, but it was never an unbearable cold or heat. Once we got settled in we went to the pool, its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it, so that was a bummer. \n\nFor lunch, we went next door to McCaffery's. They have great food and our bartender was great. \n\nHonestly, I have no complaints about our stay. Its a cute little hotel and for staying on a Saturday night, there were no dramatic noises going on and I didn't hear anyone talking in another room, having sex, or going to the bathroom. I heard a couple of door slams but I think at any hotel its typical. All the bad reviews are obviously from people who have a case of first world problems. Wahhh, \""no room service\"", Wahhh \""the rooms are too small\"", Wahhh \""I couldn't control the room temperature\"", Wahhh \""there's something I have to lift my foot up 5 inches from the ground to get over in to the shower\"", Wahhh,  Wahhh,  Wahhh.

I have been going to this IHOP every month for 4 years. Our group is anywhere from 8 to 25. There are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part, we have been seated relatively quickly. Over the past year, [[service]] has gone down hill. It started taking forever to get our order taken, get our drinks, or [[get]] our food. We are a very forgiving bunch and know it's not easy to serve a large group but as service started [[really]] sliding, our [[last]] [[trip]] ended the relationship. We had about 20 people and knew we would have to wait a bit, but after 30 minutes, we inquired how long and it was like \""your waiting for a table?\""the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups. How can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby? We called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party, which grew smaller since some left at that point. We found a new home and they will get 5 stars on my review.

I stopped in one day when I first moved here and sampled a couple of things, the chicken teriyaki, the fried gyoza, and some kind of drink. Nothing was fresh, everything tasted like old fryer grease or freezerburn (except my drink). To their credit, the service was immaculate. The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am [[really]] amazed by the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, this place is just a couple blocks from my house so I have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when I walk to the lightrail on my way to work.

My only complaint would be the hours- bums me out when I want teriyaki for dinner and they are already closed.

I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.\n\nWe've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results.

So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. \n\nI don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.\n\nThe server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.\n\nAnyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- \""the food here is terrible... and such small portions!\""\n\nI'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. \n\nAnyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it.

They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam [[plate]] below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The [[rice]] was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.\n\nI won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road.

I [[really]] [[wanted]] to like this place. I live nearby and I love the Downtown area. I want all the places here to be 4-5 star joints. But my partner and I [[showed]] up on a Sunday afternoon, with only a half-dozen people in the place and just as many waitresses, and they [[still]] [[took]] 45 minutes to deliver our food. We watched our waitress eat her lunch at the bar. And then when our food came it wasn't right.\n\nWe ordered a sandwich that was [[piled]] high with turkey. One bite, however, and we knew our [[bread]] was more than day-old.

My friend and I stopped here for a light dinner before going to a movie at the AMC theater in the same plaza. Not sure why we picked this place. I think we just both realized we were kinda hungry after we'd already parked and walked in. \n\nMi Amigo's was never really on my radar as a place to try. I'm more a fan of the hole-in-the-wall \""real\"" mexican food place. This place kinda felt like a mexican-themed, or mexican-inspired restaurant but it lacked something... almost felt like a food court with table service. \n\nThe food was fine. It wasn't bad. The service was fine. \n\nMy friend had the shrimp and garlic platter, and enjoyed it. I had a small tortilla soup. We probably over-did it with the chips and salsa. And even those were just fine. I would have liked for someone to just leave a pitcher of water (no ice) on the table because it felt like an eternity between refills and each refill succeeded in mostly adding more ice to my glass. No bueno.\n\nNo dessert, no drinks. Wasn't really feelin' it.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm jumping at the chance to eat here again. It's serviceable. If I find myself at the AZ Center and other people want to eat here, I will do my best to make suggestions to go elsewhere, but I won't encourage it. But I won't fight it if the majority rules.

Staying as airline crew at the Sheraton hotel across the street, I asked the front desk person to recommend me a good Mexican restaurant.  He recommended the \""Canyon Caf\u00e9\"" which is in the same exact mall/movie complex as this place, \""Mi Amigo's \"" .  I reviewed the Canyon Caf\u00e9's menu and didn't care for it since it's more of a Fusion restaurant, not real Mexican food.

I have to say the server was a sweetheart...very friendly, welcoming - THAT's the ONLY thing I [[liked]] about this place, aside from the Cadillac Margarita for $5.75.  I ordered the tortilla soup.  OKish; free chips and salsa - the chips were awesome, the salsa mediocre.  The worst disappointment was my main course - I ordered the Red Beef Tamales.  These are the worst tamales that I remember eating.  I can make them better myself at home!! And I am an awful cook!  I was joined by one of our flight attendants and he joined me at my table.  He pretty much reached the same concensus as I.  Sorry, but I really, really was looking forward to a nice, hot tasty Mexican meal.  I was in Arizona for crying out loud, not in North Dakota or Maine, where Mexican food may not be as widespread.   PLEASE get your menu and most importantly your ingredients in order!  My colleagues at my airline stay across the street at the Sheraton and would appreciate a nice Mexican meal on our work trips.   Thanks !!

This should [[have]] been a better experience... \n\nI'll begin with the food.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.\n\nThen the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \""lunch menu\"" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \""Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri\"".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.  \n\nWhat could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.  Giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention \""that doesn't apply\"" until the bill arrives disgraceful.  Deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time, hence the two-stars.

He had an issue, and apparently I was the target and cause of his rantings.   He was sad about the lack of customers and decided it was my fault as I mentioned I worked downtown.

Fries - same, excellent.\n\nThe staff was very attentive, hostess was cheerful and welcomed us warmly.\n\nI don't know what Tom's looked like prior to the remodel - I sure wish I would have made it to lunch before the remodel - we certainly will not go back.  $45.00 for 3 lunches and one soda - not worth it.

I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place.

I had really [[high]] hopes, and I was thrilled that it's so close to my house... However I soon started second guessing myself after pulling up. I was there before anyone else and watched the attendant avoid my car and instead go to the 2 old guys in expensive sport cars that showed up 2 or so minutes after me, and she even waited a little longer after that like she was hoping another car would pull up. When one didn't, she [[finally]] came to my car (and her attitude sucked on top of it). It's not like I own a nasty beat up car either, it's a newer Mitsubishi. After telling her I wanted a full interior detail and an exterior wash I went inside and sat around for a few hours. When it was finally done, I got what I expected, a nice, shiny, clean car.. with a soaking wet interior. Granted, I've never had an interior detail before, but I didn't expect everything to be sopping wet regardless of that. They actually put down a plastic cover over my seat for me, but since I had to stop at some place afterwards I accidently ripped it and then had to ride around with a wet bottom. I was told to keep the windows cracked an inch or 2, and did the whole weekend, however now my car kinda stinks and I'm going to be pissed if theres mold or mildew factoring into that. I'm not happy, and I'm not going back either. I'm giving them 2 stars because they did what I asked them to do: they cleaned my car.\n\nP.S. I work at an insurance company. I spoke to an appraiser and found out that places should really be doing a dry shampoo to avoid screwing up the foam bits they have under your carpets and inside your seat.

Deidre Hall was great.  It's an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you.  There were 4 different stations for alcohol samples.

I totally didn't even think about the Diamondbacks playing.  I [[had]] to drive a little bit further for parking, which was worth it.

Not sure why this location has received so many bad reviews! I used to work directly across the street from this location and would go here for lunch AT LEAST 2 times a week.

As far as \""poor choice of sides\"" go, good luck finding a franchise sandwich shop that serves fries! I prefer chips with my sandwich anyways... anyhoo.. if you are in the area around lunch time be prepared for a line, but it goes quick! :)

Alice Cooperstown is, as my husband said, \""like a Hard Rock that's not stupid.\""  The concept is a bizarre combo of Alice Cooper and a sports bar - and it works.  \n\nWe stopped by two other places to check out their menus before a game, and they didn't look very thrilling.

I've driven past this place many times on the way to Suns or D-Backs games.  Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\n\nThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:\n\n- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me \""You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine\"".....I thought she was kidding and I said, \""I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?\""....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said \""No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it\"".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\n\n- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\n\n- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\n\n- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\n\nOverall, not a good experience.  Maybe if I was a young 20 yr old it would be cool...not now.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%

There is a lot in back that [[charges]] $5.00 as well.They were about 30% full. We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress immediately. They brought a highchair for the baby too.\n   I loved the d\u00e9cor. Classic rock and roll memorabilia was the theme. Many of Alice Cooper's own items decorated the wall from tour posters to guitars. There were several large screen TVs and classic rock and roll music was playing as well. The waitresses were dresses in attire that also supported the theme.\n   The menu feature's items with a celebrity theme. I ordered the \""Adam Richman's bases loaded big unit\"" and a local micro brew. The food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. This was a 1 lb., 22\"" loaded hotdog with a good order of fries. The hot dog was an all beef hotdog on a bun loaded with sauerkraut, \""nightmare\"" chili, onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and shredded cheddar cheese. It was more than I could hope to eat, but I did do serious damage. After I got a to go box, we browsed the gift shop. Everything Alice was available.\n  This place isn't for everybody who is not into the genre. We did enjoy it and will return on special occasions. If you go make it a week day for lunch. It's probably when you'll get best for service. They are located near Chase Field, so they are probably packed on game day. The menu is a little pricy, but worth the experience.

Tickets to Phoenix Suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena. $10 tickets and $10.50 brews. I used to watch this arena on TV for years when the Suns were good and I was living elsewhere. It seems less orange in person, maybe some of the seats should be painted orange too. If you know the area, you will know not too pay for parking either. After 5pm, meters are free and obviously on the Sunday I went no charge. Try parking at 5th and monroe street. Inside the arena is pretty nice, I had a great view from the upper deck, but cmon Suns, do you really need ushers kicking people out of upper level seats. Give somebody a tiny bit of power and see what they do with it. Of course, I'm stealthy and uncatchable, so no senior citizen usher is telling me where to sit. Anyway, my team, the Brooklyn Nets won and overall a good, no hassle experience. If the Suns ever get good again, it will be worse to attend. Oh yeah, good entertainment also at least on this day. It was the gorilla's birthday and a ton of mascots were there celebrating and also the trampoline dunkers were cool and the 8 year-old girl who sang the anthem was top notch.

Last night's event was Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson-The Immortal Tour. I have to say as far as arenas go, the US Airways Center is pretty amazing.  Entering and exiting are easy-peasy. It didn't feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multi-story connected building.  \n\nThere's a Starbucks on site, which was like heaven to me . . . I wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show, There are other well-known food concessions throughout the arena, as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat.\n\nSince we were sitting in Section 102, first row, we were in the makeshift seats (the same as they put on the floor, foldables with no real back support.

Couldn't have been better.  \n\nSound quality was what you'd expect in an arena not built specifically for music, so I didn't have high expectations. \n\nI have to say that I am very impressed by the US Airways Center and all the \""nightmare\"" worries that I had about entering the building, exiting the building, finding something I wanted to drink, and of course, parking, were something I didn't have to be anxious about at all!

Summer time is supposed to be \""healthy time\"", so I am trying to watch what I eat. Now, I will always be a big guy (not \""two fat twins on their matching motorcycles\"" big, but you know, not little) but I definitely am eating more appropriately. However, I work in an office, and around 11:30, people start to double-think their lunch choices. Yes, the night before, a breakfast bowl from Jimmy Dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection, but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave? Forget it; one \""What are you doing for lunch\"" from a buddy and I was out of there.\n\nAthenian was a prime lunch spot for me for awhile, and just fell out of favor. No time like the present to return, plus SB had never been there before today. We took the 2 minute drive to Central and rolled in to a 1/3 filled Athenian Express. Happy to have missed the rush, I immediately ordered my favorite dish, the gyro feta (no tomatoes/onions, add lettuce) with fries, and SB got a chicken sub and potato salad.\n\nFirst issue, no fountain soda? If I can't destroy myself with aspartame in my free refills, it's not a great lunch. Plus, I don't like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage. Fix yo machine, Athenian!\n\nOutside of the $1.50 soda, the meal was as good as always. It was a bit lighter on the feta than usual (and LOVE me some feta goodness), but still had quite a pile. The meat was thick and cooked through, definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing Greek party. The french fries weren't overcooked, which is good because burned fries suck fully. Add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything, and times were well spent. It's a ton of food for what you pay, and one of the best deals downtown.\n\nMy coworker didn't fair quite as well, but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal. His chicken sub came with a huge breast, which I would think is a good thing, but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed (like I said, weird preferences). He demolished the entire thing, so it must have not been too bad, along with the potato salad, which he was a fan of as well.\n\nAll in all, very good lunch experience. I usually get take-out, but the Greek team had their World Cup game, so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the \""exciting\"" 0-0 match-up. If we can get some fountain sodas up in there, Athenian will likely jump back on my radar (and I may even get a salad.....maybe).

You'll notice a huge age discrepency, really young kids and then there are the adults of all ages.  So I give credz to any insitution that tries to keep kids engaged in using their minds  vs getting their game on in the mall.\n\nI love science museums, making a point to attend in any big city I travel to.  The exhibits seem lacking (even in simple terms) of the magic behind the science... hence probably why the feedback this place is so kids orientated.

Just went to the pirate exhibit this weekend and I want to write a review because it was by far the coolest one yet.  I have been to the body exhibit, the titanic exhibit and others there.  Of course there is more to do there than just that for the kids, they blow stuff up at the lab, they have tons of cool little sections with things to do.  It is not cheap but we got the annual pass for the exhibits this year since we did the maze and we wanted to come back for the pirate and the Van Gogh exhibit coming next.  Now back to the pirate exhibit, holy cow they [[had]] a real life pirates treasure at the end that was [[valued]] at 400 million dollars!  The have tons of real \""pieces of 8\"" they also recovered the bell from the original ship they found off the cost of Cape Cod.  There was their silverware, belt buckles, guns, cannons, gold, silver, rope, and I can go on forever.  It was just super cool to hear the story and see all the real life stuff.  This is not just a kid exhibit and in fact I spent much more time reading things and my kids blew right through it.

I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that \""EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round\""... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him.

We had to be near downtown today, and when scrolling through nearby restaurants on my phone I saw this one.  On Google it's rated 5 stars.  Here it's 4 stars.  And only a single dollar sign!  So we drove over.\n\nThe place looks like something you might find in Mexico.  No hostess.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in Phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.\n\nOn to the actual food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.\n\nI wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my \""regular\"" spot for Mexican food.  I would say it blows away just about every place else I've found in the Valley, and is neck-and-neck with Guerrero's (in Tempe).  I can't choose between the two at this moment.\n\nI hope to return here, and will be trying something different.  Their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes (including menudo, lengua, and albondigas).

La Tolteca is outstanding. Passing through PHX and a friend (and frequent visitor to AZ) told me I need to stop here. He spoke truth. \n\nGet the chilaquiles! Get them. \n\nWe also [[had]] tacos de papa, and caldo de camarones...the latter was awesome too, delicious broth and [[packed]] with shrimp. The salsa bar had grilled jalape\u00f1os & habanero salsa we couldn't get enough of. \n\nI'll be back to La Tolteca. Five [[stars]] no hesitation.

Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.

What a find!\nI [[found]] this place thank to my trusty Yelp app. I wanted some good, spicy Mexican food and Rosita's Place seemed to fit the bill.\nIn all honesty I was [[planning]] to go to Los Dos Molinos, but they are closed on Sundays...\n\nYou park behind the restaurant and [[walk]] around the front, dodging a few cars along the way.\nWalking in, I loved the atmosphere. It was bustling and full of life, but not overwhelmingly busy. We were seated at a table just past the indoor fish pond...hmmm.\nThe service was prompt, the chips and salsa came right out. The salsa...oh the salsa, it is delish, full of flavor and lots of heat, but in a [[good]] way.\nI ordered the chicken enchilada [[plate]] one red and one green. My companion ordered the green chili tamale plate (out of this world good).\nThey arrived glowing hot! The plates and food were so heat hot we could not start eating for about 10 minutes, (which allowed us to enjoy the ice cold beer). \nOnce the food finally cooled to a manageable temperature it was amazing!!!\nThe flavors were spot on, the chicken was super moist and each sauce was great. The refried beans here are like crack. I was so full but could not stop eating them. Yum!\n\nI'm pretty sure I have found my go-to Mexican spot in Phoenix.

I was in the market for a black floral embossed [[belt]] (no [[giant]] buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly [[support]] a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I [[certainly]] didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).\n\nI walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more \""attention grabbing\"" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this [[point]] that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down.

This didn't seem to placate the beast as he [[aggressively]] informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to [[intimidate]] me against the course of action).\n\nI don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment.

Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no.

I was in the market for a black floral embossed [[strip]] (no [[cosmic]] buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly [[uphold]] a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I [[theoretically]] didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).\n\nI walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more \""attention grabbing\"" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this [[zone]] that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he [[wilfully]] informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to [[menace]] me against the course of action).\n\nI don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment.

Maybe the current economy has forced Tacos de Juarez to make some cutbacks in the quality of their food, because our recent experience was nowhere near as good as everyone else seems to have had. We live mere [[blocks]] from here, [[so]] we felt it was about [[time]] we tried it. \n\nThe chips and tostada base tasted off, as if the oil they were fried in was a little rancid. The cheese on the cheese crisp was plentiful- and pretty oily. My husband called the cheese in his chile relleno the most [[tasteless]] he had ever had, as was the relleno batter. \n\nI ordered a #1, but wanted to substitute a hard taco for the cheese enchilada. I checked the a la carte prices, and knew that the taco was actually less expensive, so I was sure I wasn't going to be screwing them over. I can't tell you how long it took me to try and explain what I wanted to our server. I'm sure there are those who would say it's my fault for not speaking Spanish. Anyway, I ended up getting my tostada and the hard taco, but no taquito, and no rice and beans. Then another 10 minutes of my life went by as I tried to explain again what I had ordered when the server asked if everything was alright, but that really, no one needed to bring me out any more food. I had had enough by that point and knew it would already be a Pepcid AC kind of night. The cook and the server argued and finally the server understood that she had gotten my order wrong. They comped my food, which wasn't necessary, but they insisted. My taco and tostada were just alright. The beans in the tostada were cold, which I am not used to.\n\nWe've had everything better somewhere else, and feel no need to return.

Magnifico!  Great [[little]] [[place]] tucked away in a semi-residential area of town.  Felt like I was part of the family after being seated.  Bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta!  Food was [[very]] flavoful even the white rice.  Crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce.  Salsa you get red (Spicy) and green (mild) with chips and I got a complimentary Cerviche.  The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat.  Can't wait to try other dishes when I return to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!

At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to [[settle]] for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \n\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish [[had]] about 150 [[pin]] bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \n\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche.

It [[had]] been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an [[assembly]] line, Chipotle Style dang it) [[so]] anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.  \nI'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps.

Under construction when I visited today, but still beautiful. Fellow botanical garden-ers were friendly. \n\nBottled water is not overpriced. At 1.50 a bottle, it didn't sting that I forgot to bring my own water.\n\nPark rangers are stern, silently watching and protecting our pic-a-nik baskets from any impending doom.\n\nWear your best, as there are tons of photographers running around.

Signs were clearly posted leading the way to the wedding site *and the rehearsal the night before) and the restrooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant to use. \n\nThere was a very large room with shuttered windows and AC where my daughter and her wedding party dressed and a smaller, similar room where the groom and his group readied themselves. After the wedding, as the chairs and such were put away, the entire group came back to the same area which is a small courtyard and had a cocktail hour. \n\nMy daughter and her husband were married in the far back arena where they have the outdoor concerts and therein lies the only reason this wonderful place does not get five stars. \n\nIf you have your wedding at this particular site, park your car in the dirt lot that is adjacent to the unloading area. It is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads \""Service area only.\"" I understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day, it would've been so much better to park in back and take a 5 min. walk as opposed to an agonizing 15 min. stroll. \nIt was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended, it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out. \n\nIt was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking (you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesn't eat in the dark.)

It is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads \""Service area only.\"" I understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day, it would've been so much better to park in back and take a 5 min. walk as opposed to an agonizing 15 min. stroll. \nIt was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended, it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out. \n\nIt was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking (you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesn't eat in the dark.) Lovely place to have a party or wedding, parking not so great. \n\nThank you DBG for making my daughter's wedding so very memorable!

Stayed here for a long weekend for a friend's wedding in Mesa. Driving from Southern California, it was located conveniently near the freeway and parking was easy! Check in was a breeze, the receptionist was very friendly- he [[gave]] us two warm cookies and a map of the surrounding area to help us out. Looks a bit outdated from the outside, but don't judge a book by the cover- the rooms are definitely kept up very nicely! The room was [[so]] spacious! Upon entering, there is a couch that turns into a bed, with a desk that was convenient when we ordered pizza and ate around it. There is a microwave, large fridge and everything was [[so]] clean! The separate room was nice, with a king bed that was large and comfy and had nice closet space to hang our clothes for the wedding. We went to the Belvedere restaurant downstairs on the first night to grab some drinks and the drinks were very overpriced but I guess that's expected for a hotel bar. We loved everything about the hotel, especially the complimentary breakfast located in the restaurant. Buffett style, with a different main entree that differed everyday (like french toast, pancakes, and waffles) with sausage, bacon, yogurt, pastries and coffee! Would definitely recommend staying here and will plan on returning to this hotel once baseball spring training comes around for my Dodgers!

BEWARE!! \n\nI had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for [[approximately]] one hour. I then [[drove]] from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. \n\nPhotos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles \""it must have vibrated off after service.\"" \n\n\nI may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever \""vibrated off\"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car.

The PHX zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large, charismatic megafauna.  However, if you are like me, you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display.  There is very little of this, the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe, if you are lucky, the country where the animal lives. The zoo is also mammal heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love a good mammal display, but I also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles.  If that is what you like to see, the PHX zoo is not the place for you.  They do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians, but that is it for the herps...  They also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall, they lack the fish, amphibians, and reptiles.  Also, where is the insect collections? Maybe I missed it.\n\nThe animals do have very large enclosures, but some look under kept.  Also, there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species.  They have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now...  a shame...\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo, the admission was pricey, and the breadth of animals small.

Well this [[has]] been one of my favorite courses since I moved here in 1988. I have played this course many, many times. [[However]] it has a few years since I have been there and I had yet to play the new renovated course.  I have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so I was excited to play the course again and see the new changes.  I was a little disappointed.  The carts are new Club Car's and they are equipped with a GPS featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be. I can certain understand how this is a good idea. However I think they have the settings a little too high.  If you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages.  The cart paths are for the most part gone.  They are still in a temporary club house from 2 years ago.  I read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges.   That is an understatement. \n\nSo I guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other Phoenix landmarks that are now gone.  Similar to the old Cine Capri Movie theater on 24th street.  I would rather remember Papago Golf Course as the great muni it was, rather then the course in disrepair that it is now.

I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know, Ajo Al's, Macayo's, Garcia's, etc.  At this point, it is still a treat for me, but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu, dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place.  El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week. \n\nWe showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.  I had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again.  We'll be back to El Nopalito often.  I'm excited to try the 99 cent street tacos.

Tried this place on a lazy Sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews, and I would say what others have said is pretty accurate. It is very authentic, looks like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. But, the tacos here are great! Now, just to be clear, these are street style tacos, they are small, but they are only $0.99/each, which seems pretty reasonable. \n\nI ordered an adobada, al pastor, carnitas, and a shredded beef with red chiles. Each were very good in their own unique ways, the meat was [[good]] quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, so much that I had to go back and order another one! I also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nSo far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco looked good, and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well. \n\nThey also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful. Our server was very friendly, patient, nice and helpful. \n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a good taco shop, nothing fancy, and authentic, this might be your best bet. Or at least it is from the places I have been so far...

Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills (you can buy a bottle of 10,000 for $6 at Costco)... but I hate this place. \n\nI break out in hives every time I think about having to go here... So then why do I go here, you may ask. The same [[reason]] as everyone else. The same reason listed in all of these glowing reviews... to save a little bit of money.\n\nI come here for almost the same thing every time. Diet Coke, allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast. Those are my three go-to items. Every few months there's the toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent... blah, blah, blah. You know the drill.\n\nWhy do I hate it so...? \n\nPretty much for the same reason I have a deep disdain for Walmart. It's chaos. And in true Walmart fashion, I actually saw someone wearing their pajamas here the other day. \n\nPeople walk around here lulled into some kind of trance by price savings and free samples. It's maddening. In the parking lot, in the store... waiting to turn INTO the parking lot... people are crazy. They completely stop paying attention to what's going on around them. I've been touched inappropriately by shopping carts, nearly run into by cars. It's insanity. \n\nOh and by the way, speaking of parking lots... why the hell aren't there more cart return areas. I think I've seen two... It's generally a game of, can I find a spot to hide this cart, or should I just walk it to the front of the store. \n\nAnother thing: A lot of people talk about the great fuel savings... I've never purchased fuel here. Wanna know why? Because every time I come here, the line for fuel is no less than 3 cars deep per lane! No thanks. I'll pay 10 cents more per gallon somewhere else. \n\nAs I sit here typing... anxiety level rising, I wonder to myself... are the savings really worth it? And for now, sadly, the answer is yes. But one day... One Day Costco! I will be free.

Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills (you can buy a bottle of 10,000 for $6 at Costco)... but I hate this place. \n\nI break out in hives every time I think about having to go here... So then why do I go here, you may ask. The same [[intellect]] as everyone else. The same reason listed in all of these glowing reviews... to save a little bit of money.\n\nI come here for almost the same thing every time. Diet Coke, allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast. Those are my three go-to items. Every few months there's the toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent... blah, blah, blah. You know the drill.\n\nWhy do I hate it so...? \n\nPretty much for the same reason I have a deep disdain for Walmart. It's chaos. And in true Walmart fashion, I actually saw someone wearing their pajamas here the other day. \n\nPeople walk around here lulled into some kind of trance by price savings and free samples. It's maddening. In the parking lot, in the store... waiting to turn INTO the parking lot... people are crazy. They completely stop paying attention to what's going on around them. I've been touched inappropriately by shopping carts, nearly run into by cars. It's insanity. \n\nOh and by the way, speaking of parking lots... why the hell aren't there more cart return areas. I think I've seen two... It's generally a game of, can I find a spot to hide this cart, or should I just walk it to the front of the store. \n\nAnother thing: A lot of people talk about the great fuel savings... I've never purchased fuel here. Wanna know why? Because every time I come here, the line for fuel is no less than 3 cars deep per lane! No thanks. I'll pay 10 cents more per gallon somewhere else. \n\nAs I sit here typing... anxiety level rising, I wonder to myself... are the savings really worth it? And for now, sadly, the answer is yes. But one day... One Day Costco! I will be free.

What [[happened]] to all of the coverage on the local sports?  The Arcadia News used to be very supportive and involved in Arcadia High School athletics.  No articles and only some pictures of some of the sports these days.  Shouldn't a local paper support its local high school?

I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion), but this one [[holds]] a special place for me. I'd just driven into Phoenix on a Wednesday afternoon, after a long drive across the country. Earlier in the day I'd signed the lease on my apartment and confirmed with the movers when they were coming the next morning. \n\nSo this tired chick hopped on Yelp to find some food -- nearby, familiar, and good enough. I found this Applebee's not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone). It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis. The people here were friendly enough, and I like their \""550\"" menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories. \n\nSo while I've grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain. This one was there for a very tired chick who needed some hot food and a nearby Target!

Terrie really made our experience. I love Applebees anyway, but she really treated us like we were the only table she had. \n\nWe walked in at 11:11pm on a Sunday, the place closes at midnight.

We also had spinach and artichoke dip, they gave us lots of [[chips]] and Terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa. \n\nNext time I am in Phoenix and want Applebee's, I will go to this location simply because of the service we received.

Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a [[sad]] clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!

A very [[odd]] experience.  \n\nWe entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well, yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant, to the back door of the bar.  Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.  \n\nOnce you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.  \n\nFinally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.  \n\nThey feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.  Our server was nice and attentive.  \n\nThe entire time we were there, I was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about.

It's my little sister's 17th birthday (yes, I feel old considering I remember changing her diapers!) and I wanted to do something [[special]] for her. I considered using one of the online services (ProFlowers, 1-800 Flowers, etc.) but I really wanted the \""wow\"" effect of the flowers arriving all arranged and gorgeous. So (of course) I turned to Yelp and found Cactus Flowers. \n\nThey have a great website showing photos of all their arrangements (see \""Cactus Flower Exclusives\"" for prearranged, local [[delivery]] options), and they even offer national deliveries through FTD. I found a gorgeous bouquet and even [[had]] the option of adding balloons, chocolates, and a teddy bear. I went with the balloons because I was sending them to my sister's school and I just [[HAD]] to go for the best (AKA most embarrassing) visual display possible!! \n\nI placed the order yesterday (hooray for next-day delivery - and even same-day delivery if you order before 1pm) and realized today that I did not specify delivery time. Having the flowers arrive after she's left school for the day isn't the surprise I was going for!! So I sent them an email explaining the situation and asked ever so nicely that they please try to deliver before 2pm. Just over an hour later, which was after noon in Arizona - less than 2 hours before my requested delivery time - I received a response that it was taken care of. How great is that?!?! \n\nI'm still waiting to get a call from my sister (I'm sure I'll post an update later today to say how it turned out), but right now they have a very satisfied customer! \n\nThe Cactus Flower Exclusives are gorgeous and go for $35 and up (+ tax and delivery, which is $13 - $15). National deliveries also start at $35 + tax and delivery. \n\n- 1 Star because the bouquet arrangements most people lean towards start at about $50, which is kinda pricey (only smaller arrangements with a handful of short stem flowers in a short vase are $35)

Oh, AJ's. If you didn't exist less than 3 blocks from my apartment, I would never go to you. Although you have high-class pretensions, and several amicable sommeliers, your employees are aware that you are a ripoff.\n\nCase in point: I go to AJ's on St. Paddy's day, 2010, looking for some corned beef. 1 corned beef steak remains. About 2 pounds. Price: 25.00. When I lived in Oregon [[last]] year, I was able to get 4 pounds of corned beef (a very cheap [[cut]] and preparation of beef) for under $10. I mentioned the price gouging to the guy behind the meat counter, and I quote: \""Hahahahahahahaha!!!\"" -- Nothing else. No joke. They know they're overpriced. They sell the [[exact]] same things as food city for 4x the price (same company owns fry's, food city, and AJ's) because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of AJ's will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the Spanish [[Mass]] at their local catholic church, and worthy of more than $2 apiece.\n\nFurthermore, more whole and organic foods are sold at any one Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Fresh and Easy, and Whole Foods than any AJ's that ever existed.\n\nAvoid this place unless you're a yuppie with too [[much]] money and not enough sense, or unless you think one of the sommeliers is hot. 2 stars for the awesome beer selection.

Love the food, quality, and cleanliness. The staff Jimmy and Austin were both friendly and helpful and customer oriented. The few times I've been in though the female servers were standing around chatting about their personal things loudly and not tending to tables as quickly as they should, that is what kept me from giving a five star. Otherwise, [[awesome]] [[place]] to eat.

[[Really]] good lunch spot for takeout (the restaurant is divided into takeout and dine-in, and the dine-in portion is relatively small for large groups). I'm a big fan of the classic mozzarella sandwich and vanilla bean rice pudding. They don't have much on their menu online, but the few items they do have, they do really well. If you order takeout, make sure to call in 15 minutes before your pick up time so that they'll have it ready. Otherwise, you'll be waiting for your takeout. \n\nIf you're going for a market sandwich, I recommend calling in to get their special. It can be a hit or miss. I got a market sandwich without calling once and ended up with a turkey sloppy Joe. It had a great taste but extremely messy and oily to eat.

I like to focus on the [[positive]] so let's start there. The hot wings. Get em spicy hot. They were really good. Worth going here for? No\n\nIt's a dark bar, my date liked the English vibe of it.\n\nThe waitresses were slow (but pleasant) with bringing the drinks and once we did get them the drinks sucked. I ordered a Irish Car Bomb and got less than half a glass of warm Guiness, with the tiniest shot of baileys/whiskey. It was almost undrinkable. Then I ordered the $2.50 drink shot special which tasted like a shot of kool-aid.\n\nWe went for the Monday karaoke, and the DJ was good enough but there was this little tv in the corner with the lyrics displayed. I've just been to better karaoke bars (i.e. Ernies)\n\nLike I said my date liked this place, so I guess YMMV. I think I would have liked it more if the service was better and the drinks were up to par.

I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the [[place]] feels worn in, but not worn down.  I [[feel]] comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the [[rather]] [[large]] selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up [[getting]] food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it.

Perhaps its because I've learned over the years how to communicate to boutique shop owners that I'm not \""just looking\"" but I'm on a hunt for the perfect fucking end tables and I hate chrome.\n\nYou would be surprised how far that approach goes at any place: tell the owner what you like and don't like right away. Letting them know you [[have]] an opinion allows them to engage with you as someone who [[appreciates]] design; not just another customer.\n\nNow with that rant out of the way, I'd like to let you know that you'll find some cool shit here. Its a serious challenge to see everything there is in such a cramped place, so plan ahead to spend some time there. And for the love of God, don't bring your kid. In fact, go alone so you can make it around easier.\n\nYou wont find everything in perfect condition, but the prices are very reasonable. I felt like I was getting away with murder when I picked up a lamp last time. Go support Petey and his dog, they're good at what they do.

I really hate to [[give]] this place a less than stellar [[review]] because I want to like it so badly! The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making [[outside]] and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get [[service]] to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong! \nNow, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville.

If the stale retirement home setting and stuck-in-the-80's styled menu don't encourage you to leave before ordering, waiting for the amateur service will.\n\nOh, you're [[still]] here? Ok, go ahead and order any of their so-called omelettes. Be sure to also ask for lots of [[napkins]] because you'll be crying when you finally see the nonsense that comes out of the kitchen.\n\nThe way I see it, cooking omlettes is very simple: you take good ingredients, mix them together, cook it all without burning.

Hubby insisted we had eaten here before. I thought not. I was partly right, as we have eaten at the Good Egg before, and not been very pleased. Hubby had hated their crepe-eggs. We didn't know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down.\n\nStarving, I [[order]] their farmhouse eggs benedict and Hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an Oreo pancake (he just HAD to try it). We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with [[bad]] [[tap]] water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, [[nasty]] substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask.

I signed up for this, however they didn't call me the last time I had a refillb ready because they weren't aware it needed to be refilled, and the time before that they called me to tell me it was ready and when I showed up it wasn't ready.

One woman followed me around and kept trying to offer helpful suggestions \""all you have to do is ask\""....Uh thanks but I think I got this all figured out.  Tried to make as little eye contact on checkout and the cashier kept saying creapy shit like \""well I know you'll be back\"".  \n\nDo people walk into adult stores and ask for help and recommendations?

The only reason I'm [[giving]] this [[place]] two stars instead of one star is because I [[really]] had a good appointment with Whitney Padgett, the nurse practitioner. She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a [[good]] listener. However, in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the [[reasons]] why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and I decide to have a baby. I was a [[happy]] patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \""Are you sexually active?\"" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience.

The only reason I'm [[alienating]] this [[district]] two stars instead of one star is because I [[unexpectedly]] had a good appointment with Whitney Padgett, the nurse practitioner. She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a [[agreeable]] listener. However, in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the [[philosophies]] why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and I decide to have a baby. I was a [[delightful]] patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \""Are you sexually active?\"" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment.

Dam I wish I would have known this place was here sooner. Really good sandwiches. They use Boars Head meat which I am a huge fan of. They have so many different sandwiches it took me a while to figure out what I wanted. The menu is kinda all over the place. There is a menu board but its old and fadeed but they have white papers with all the sandwiches hung up all over the wall. The staff  are very [[friendly]] and I'm sure this [[place]] has many regulars. Inside its a tight squeeze with limited seating. The macaroni salad is great as is the potatoe salad. I love the sicilian sub. The italian dressing on it is so really [[good]] and I think thats why I like this sub so much. My other fav is the club on wheat. Oh yeah I think Ill go there agin today. Sanwhiches range from $5.95-6.95.

It has been a good year or two since I have eaten here last and I'm not sure why. Today reinforced how much I like this place. To me, Qdoba falls into the Chipotle category although I feel the portions are definitely more generous than Chipotle. I like to get the Naked Chicken Burrito which is essentially a burrito with no tortilla. So, basically the Chipotle burrito bowl. It is just under $6 and enough for two meals. I'll instantly halve it when I get home to prevent me from overeating. It is very good. Their guacamole is very good, too. They also have a pick 2 combo for $6 and gives you smaller portions of your choice of the [[naked]] burrito, mexican soup, tacos, cheese quesadilla, etc. The other thing I like about this place is the rewards program and also how nice the employees always are. Like I said, it has been a long time since I have been back and I always comment on how friendly the employees are. Good sign.

Last year, our very active toddler (then 2-yrs-old) was diagnosed with a bone cyst in his femur. Our pediatrician gave us a list of orthopedic surgeons to consult and although Dr. Shindell was at the top of the list, we actually went to the second name -- one of the largest orthopedic groups in the valley -- first. When we met with that first surgeon, he said he could help our son but given the size and placement of the cyst and the risk of it breaking, he recommended that we go to someone who handles these type of cases more often. We asked who he would recommend if it were his son, and he said Dr. Shindell.\n\nWhen we called Dr. Shindell's office, they were [[able]] to get us in for an appointment the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely anxious, but Dr. Shindell's calm demeanor and extensive experience helped us worry less. He explained all the options (including a brand new procedure that just finished clinical trials) and possible long-term effects. There was absolutely no pressure to take any one option over the others, and he was willing to give us the weekend to think over our options.\n\nIt took us about 20-minutes to decide what to do. Dr. Shindell immediately set up the surgery date and called Hanger Orthotics to squeezed us in for a fitting even though it was the end of day on a Friday.\n\nThe following week, our son had his surgery (would have been sooner, but we had to wait for his custom brace to be made). Dr. Shindell met us at the hospital to explain the details of the surgery ahead of time. After the surgery, he met us in the waiting room and explained the recovery plan and what to expect. Shindell again checked on our son the following day to see how he was recovering. Every time, he explained everything fully so that we could understand what was going on.\n\nWe still see Dr. Shindell regularly to check on the progress of our son's bone graft. Although he seemed very stoic when we first met him, we also have seen how much he personally cares about each patient... and their parents.\n\nWe are absolutely grateful for Dr. Shindell!

This afternoon Rand H. and I stopped in for an early dinner. It was nice and cool inside. There was a booth available to our left as we stepped in the door. We were greeted with chips and each our own little bowl of spicy good salsa. No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno & shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.\n\nNo more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me. (The fish was served flayed open with head and tail still attached.)\nONE WORD:  Yummy! It was tasty as can be, and I was glad, as I normally order a Carne Asada Burrito when I eat Mexican food. I highly recommend this spot and It's a shame Alexander and Nader had such a soggy humid experience here. It seems to have been fixed as this was not the case on my first visit here this evening. \n\nOh, and I liked the old photos of things like Poncho Villa's Wanted poster and other early 1900's historical Mexican events.

For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. \n\nBut alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.\n\nWhile waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I [[went]] through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. \n\nSo he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.\n\n\""Awwww, man, now you've locked us out,\"" we say, playfully.\n\nThe DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with \""Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out\"" before walking off with his cigarette.\n\n\""What the hell just happened?\"" I ask.\n\""He thinks we're a straight couple.\"" \nI laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.\n\nI tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. \n\nI knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.\n\nI'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.\n\nOh well. Torrid and Guitar Center seem to do just fine without my business. I'm sure Cruisin 7th will do just fine.

Really, you guys think chips should be the basis of a good or bad rating????? wow how about the actual food, the real meal, not the free stuff in front of you to nibble while you are waiting.\nJuan's has awesome food, nothing I haven't liked yet, red, green, chicken, carne asada. you name it mmmm good.\nOld school eating without all the bells and whistles. They don't load the plate with a pound of cheese and a half a pound of garnish like some places (carlos O) does.\nNor do they just do 1 thing great and forget the rest- it's all great. And then you have other places that grill meat or do something fancy with fish/chicken or meat and slop half cooked rice and garbage beans on your plate. This is good home grown mexican food! Great family that has made an awesome business themselves. Many many others must agree or they wouldn't be so packed most of the time, great neighborhood place too, that's why you see them do so many take out orders.

This is a [[tough]] one. This restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food. \n\nUnfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly [[anytime]] during the week, [[night]] or day. Even take-out usually takes over an hour!\n\nI suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted.

That being said, food isn't [[going]] to make me return to a [[place]] to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my [[expectations]] and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!

Have not been here in years.  The food & the service were not good. And you would think that a margarita at a Mexican restaurant would at least be drinkable, but it was so [[sweet]] I could not drink it. It may have been an off night, but I think I will probably wait a few more years again to go back.

We recently went to Clyde's Hardware for a replacement part for a bidet.  Salesman was helpful but had to order the part which he [[did]] on the computer or so we thought.  [[Told]] us the part was in stock, took our credit card [[payment]] and [[told]] us a day when the part would be there.  But they NEVER ordered the part!!  When I inquired, Debbie was curt to say the least.  Later [[called]] me and [[told]] me the part \""was on back order!\""  Not [[so]] according to the salesman.\n\nWhy oh why would we want to do business with them in the future?  We were required to pay shipping ($13.00 for a plastic part that weighed no more than 1/2 ounce) plus tax, plus [[made]] several trips to the store and to be treated like that??  No wonder amazon and other competitors are cleaning their clocks and they have a sign on their door not allowing photos.

We [[had]] planned on going to the Rhythm Room, which is directly across the street, but they were [[still]] charging a full cover at midnight, and just wanting to have a late-night cocktail, we took our hard-earned cash to Friends.  Just as we walked in, a drag show was ending, which was a treat.  Only wishing we had gotten there sooner, we sat down and ordered drinks.  I was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have.  Not feeling too adventurous in that area I ordered a Ketel One Citroen on the rocks.  Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am [[sure]] it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.\n\nThis place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.  It was a great way to end a great night out.\n\nAlso, I would totally wear a friends T-shirt if they have them.  I love the logo.

Now let me preface this review by saying I am an East [[Coast]] gal with over 30 yrs experience in eating the BEST [[Pizza]] & I absolutely love the crust (hand tossed of course) @ Pizza Heaven. I was walking back from the Christmas [[light]] show and saw the PH sign in [[Neon]] Orange calling me into this place.  Right Choice. Since then I have been there weekly and sometimes twice a week.   The crust is crunchy and the cheese is delicately [[melting]] throughout.  I always get mine with pepperoni but when ever I spot someone else pizza looking a smelling divine (pardon the pun Heavenly) I change the order to find that I now have another favorite  Ranch Chicken Pizza. Who would have thought cheddar cheese would taste that good on pizza. TRY IT!!!!  One thing, service is different in the day time, counter lady is very helpful in knowing the menu there & that's a plus and when I come during the evening, the sit and be waited on service is not so terrific.The boys tend to sit at the counter and surf the phones and talk with the kitchen staff and forget about the tables. I'd rather come during the day or take out to get better service.\nWish they had a full bar to sit at that would be fun and an outside venue too.

If you trade in items, you will get 35% of the retail price in cash or 50% in trade credit, period. The young ladies who run the shop are razor sharp and know the tastes of their shoppers. The store has an interesting selection of accessories and clothing, the quality of which runs the gamut from cute cheap Chinese crap to OMG is this [[really]] $15 superior quality items. Look and look often because inventory turns over and fast. If you want a quick hit of something unique or need to offload some extra items, make a beeline for this place. It's environmentally responsible and they have a donation program for local nonprofit agencies. This is NOT a thrift store, so leave that notion at home. It's a secondhand shop that thinks like a consignment store. You pay a little more than a thrift store but you have a much greater chance of finding something fantastic in pristine condition.

It's environmentally responsible and they have a donation program for local nonprofit agencies. This is NOT a thrift store, so leave that notion at home. It's a secondhand shop that thinks like a consignment store. You pay a little more than a thrift store but you have a much greater chance of finding something fantastic in pristine condition.

This is the first time I've [[had]] a bad experience at an Oreck store. My 6 year old sweeper suddenly began spewing dirt out. The bag wasn't close to full yet and it didnt appear anything was stuck. The [[sales]] associate without opening it up began to insist I needed a new roller brush for $40. When I showed him it looked [[fine]] to me and wouldn't that be covered by warranty, he got upset with me and began stomping around. I also showed him a warranty sticker from 2010 on the machine which stated that there was a new roller brush installed and also asked him to look up my Oreck warranty. He found my name in their system and then began shoving my sweeper at me insisting I just take it and leave then, since I obviously didn't trust him. This man was totally weird and his behavior and attitude felt very unprofessional.  I still like Oreck but do not recommend this store.

I like domino's pizza when I just want to have cheap [[pizza]] delivered.  This location however is awful.  They [[have]] messed up the last 3 orders.  1, the crust was missing its seasoning completely and the cheese was half missing - what?  2. the [[order]] arrives [[well]] over 30 minutes late and wasn't piping hot like you expect.  When i called to check on my tardy order, the manager Carla was [[rude]] and told me \""not to worry about it.\"" What again?  3. I ordered a hand tossed, to hopefully get the garlicky crust I missed out on previously, and they [[delivered]] a pan pizza 10 minutes late.  How [[does]] one [[make]] the online [[order]] THAT wrong?  It prints out.  There are only so many crust options.  Carla was rude this time too - if you mess up okay, but don't make it worse by treating your already frustrated paying customer like crap.

My wife (who is from [[Phoenix]] and spent [[countless]] meals at this restaurant) characterized this [[place]] to me as the \""Gay Denny's\""--a label I was apprehensive about mentioning in my review until I read the the reviews of other Yelpers.  After seeing about a dozen or more references to \""Jenny's\"", I [[realized]] that my wife's characterization is not only accurate, but [[quite]] routine and popular.  Please note that even Yelp categorizes this place under \""Diners, Gay Bars\"".  That speaks volumes of coolness.\n\nThere is little to distinguish this from any other Denny's, and during the [[day]] it is the mild-mannered place we are all familiar with.  But at night, and [[particularly]] in the wee hours of the morning, the alt crowd arrives.  Many people from Goth and LGBTQ clubs pile in here for food at that time after dancing and socializing.  My wife and I went here after our visit to Sanctum--she walked in with her Gothy attire and no-one batted an eye.  The place had quite a crowd at 2am and they were mostly a fairly young, hip group.\n\nFood was. . .Denny's.  Service was fine.  If you go here at 2am, you know you're not going for the food in particular but for the crowd and maybe some people watching if you're into that sort of [[thing]].  If you're looking for a great place to get some post clubbing eats, Jenny's definitely hits a Grand Slam.  Recommended.

My boyfriend summed up our experience at Coup Des Tartes pretty well, even with the spelling and grammar issues - I swear he's college educated; he just thinks it's 'kool' to 'right' in his own unique style :)\n\nI'm just going to add my own two cents...\nAfter reading so many great reviews of this place, we were both pretty excited to try it out.  I made our reservations online with no problem.  As he said, going on a Wednesday night was perfect - it was not too crowded and we received great service. Claire and Mona took great [[care]] of us... great ambiance and food too - To start, I went with the Roquefort [[Salad]] (their signature salad) and it was delicious! Jared was happy with his mussels appetizer as well.  They brought plenty of bread and butter for him to sop up the sauce as well - it too was fresh, moist, and yummy. Jared had the chicken entree and I had the lobster... I really enjoyed it - the lobster itself was flavorful and it also had a light sweet sauce (with coconut) that enhanced each bite.  I liked that it came with asparagus as well as a risotto.  I didn't love that the risotto had pineapple in it, but that may be just me.  We didn't need it but J twisted my arm to share a dessert... chocolate crusted cheesecake with an orange sauce and fresh berries - the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful meal!\n\nIf you like quaint, unique, local places, check out Coup Des Tartes - you won't be disappointed!

Ok, so this was [[really]] incredibly depressing.  We had [[heard]] such wonderful things about this place, and even [[really]] enjoyed mother's day brunch here.\n\nBUT, when we [[went]] here last night for our anniversary dinner, it was incredibly lackluster.  the brie brulee was ok.  my husband's filet was very underwhelming (though the risotto was delicious), my pork was good, and the four [[berry]] tart was yummy.\n\nThe problem was that we could have spent that [[money]] somewhere else on an even better meal.  Having moved recently from San Francisco, we try to stop ourselves from over criticizing, but we've found some real gems in Phoenix.  Coup des Tartes is not one of them. :(

Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear [[tart]] desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY [[slow]] service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.   To sum up, it would be a nice place for a date, but I won't be back and I know a place not to far from there that I would MUCH rather go to given the choice.

If you're on Twitter you'll [[see]] [[so]] many different [[places]] you can follow. Its cool to because they announce deals and such that are coming soon. For instance, Coup des Tartes tweeted that they would [[be]] running the Yelp Eats menu this past Friday and Saturday. I was super excited because the [[night]] I was supposed to go there was a family emergency and I [[had]] to cancel. Anyway, once we arrived we were given the [[standard]] menu so we [[asked]] about the Yelp Eats menu, \""oh yeah sure\"". What was [[brought]] back was not the Yelp Eats menu but some 3 [[course]] prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one Yelp Eats item on it. No [[onion]] tart, no lamb shank etc.. [[VERY]] [[disappointing]] and irritating. Do not call a Ferrari a Corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing. \n\nAnyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door. \n\nAt the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't. Very misleading, the classic bait and switch apparently still works.
