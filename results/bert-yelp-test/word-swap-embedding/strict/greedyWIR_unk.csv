Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.

Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.

I went with the balloons because I was [[dispatch]] them to my sister's [[schooling]] and I just HAD to go for the best ([[ALIAS]] most embarrassing) visual display possible!! \n\nI placed the order yesterday ([[hurray]] for next-day delivery - and even same-day delivery if you [[decree]] before 1pm) and [[realised]] today that I did not [[specifies]] delivery time. Having the [[flowering]] [[arrived]] after she's left [[schooling]] for the day isn't the surprise I was going for!! So I sent them an email explaining the situation and asked ever so nicely that they please try to deliver before 2pm. Just over an hour later, which was after noon in Arizona - less than 2 hours before my requested delivery time - I received a response that it was taken care of. How great is that?!?! \n\nI'm still waiting to get a [[calling]] from my sister (I'm sure I'll post an update later today to say how it turned out), but right now they have a very satisfied customer! \n\nThe Cactus Flower Exclusives are gorgeous and go for $35 and up (+ tax and delivery, which is $13 - $15). National deliveries also start at $35 + tax and delivery. \n\n- 1 Star because the bouquet arrangements most people lean towards start at about $50, which is kinda pricey (only smaller arrangements with a handful of short stem flowers in a short vase are $35)"
