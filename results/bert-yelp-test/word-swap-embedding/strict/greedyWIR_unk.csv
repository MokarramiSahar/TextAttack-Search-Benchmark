The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""""bacon\"""" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""""meat\"""".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"""".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.","Failed"

And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers.

I'm going to [[begins]] a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  [[merry]] hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are [[alright]], but they [[assuredly]] aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are [[grand]] and the asparagus is okay, but I [[thought]]  at high [[terminates]] steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons, Capital [[Grill]],  Ruth Chris, Hyde Park.  And, for bar area and bar dining Capital Grille, Hyde Park, Mortons, Ruth Chris.","Successful"

But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the [[deal]]...\n\nI [[love]] Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is [[awesome]]. Plus, of course, the food is [[fantastic]]. However, I [[wanted]] to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great [[reviews]], so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open [[Table]] [[reservation]] [[feature]], and scored a [[table]] for two on a Saturday [[night]]. \n\nOur [[reservation]] was for 8:30. We [[arrived]] right on the [[dot]], but were told to go to the bar and [[wait]]. So, my boyfriend and I both [[got]] cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs [[hard]] to [[mess]] up, and I [[got]] the [[Peachy]] Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our [[table]] was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was [[fantastic]]. Very [[attentive]], friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday.

But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the [[dealing]]...\n\nI [[adore]] Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is [[gorgeous]]. Plus, of course, the food is [[extraordinary]]. However, I [[wanna]] to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great [[inspecting]], so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open [[Tables]] [[booking]] [[characteristics]], and scored a [[tables]] for two on a Saturday [[nightly]]. \n\nOur [[booking]] was for 8:30. We [[arrive]] right on the [[points]], but were told to go to the bar and [[awaiting]]. So, my boyfriend and I both [[get]] cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs [[arduous]] to [[disarray]] up, and I [[get]] the [[Groovy]] Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our [[tables]] was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was [[beautiful]]. Very [[observant]], friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check.

It was early in the evening, though.\n\nI love General Tso's chicken, and most of the time, it is not that spicy, to appeal to a wider audience. \n\nI ordered the dinner special, which came with fried rice and an egg roll.   I could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter, and was able to watch as my food was prepared.\n\nIt came [[expeditiously]], and I took it home.  As I was leaving, there were more people coming in.\n\nI got home and grabbed a beer, and got into my order.  And the General Tso's was spicy!!!  The way it should be!!\n\nIt was a generous portion, and the fried rice was flavorful.  The egg roll, well it was an egg roll, but I love egg rolls as well!\n\nBe mindful, this was just a review of one dish.  I do have to go back and try more!","Successful"

I [[thought]] the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in [[supplying]] an [[pleasant]] experiance.\n After ordering our first drinks and [[completing]] it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another [[drank]]; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what [[typing]] of [[vino]] i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of [[taxi]] and just [[fell]] it at the table- no [[cite]] of [[annum]], make, and region, just a heres a glass of [[vino]], i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass [[vino]], nothing. And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to [[ceasing]] him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \"""" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\""""\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less.\nFour star 4 diamond yea right.","Failed"

It is a city-owned course on the [[northeast]] side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a [[couple]] of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.

The recent rains led to a lot of [[flooding]] on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I [[especially]] like the [[Bridges]] since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there [[always]] seems to be a [[bit]] of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the [[Bridges]] is the [[kind]] of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively [[difficult]] par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a [[challenge]] to [[keep]] you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the [[area]]. \n\nThe major downside to the [[Bridges]] is the [[proximity]] to the airport.  Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.

Fix yo machine, Athenian!\n\nOutside of the $1.50 soda, the meal was as good as always. It was a bit lighter on the feta than usual (and LOVE me some feta goodness), but still had quite a pile. The meat was thick and cooked through, definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing Greek party. The french fries weren't overcooked, which is good because burned fries suck fully. Add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything, and times were well spent. It's a ton of food for what you pay, and one of the best deals downtown.\n\nMy coworker didn't fair quite as well, but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal. His chicken sub came with a huge breast, which I would think is a good thing, but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed (like I said, weird preferences). He demolished the entire thing, so it must have not been too bad, along with the potato salad, which he was a fan of as well.\n\nAll in all, very good lunch experience. I usually get take-out, but the Greek team had their World Cup game, so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the \""""exciting\"""" 0-0 match-up. If we can get some fountain sodas up in there, Athenian will likely jump back on my radar (and I may even get a salad.....maybe).","Skipped"

I would rather remember Papago Golf Course as the great muni it was, rather then the course in disrepair that it is now.","Successful"

Most hotels pools are only like 4-5 deep due to [[fright]] of drowning liability.  I am a [[large]] fan of deep pools and rare they are to find.  So for me that is another nice [[traits]] to this property.\n\nIt is in a quiet [[zoning]] of town and lots of neat things around to do.. just 3 miles from Camel Back Drive and [[tonnes]] to do on that road..
