The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.

Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \""fixed\"" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the \""manager\"" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too.

I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a [[smile]] and she literally [[turned]] away. I finally had to walk to them to [[get]] their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender [[brought]] food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up.

I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \""games\"", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.

Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?

As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I [[got]] a car (or made friends with cars), but [[I]] was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - [[pushy]] lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang [[hooked]] you up with extras because \""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\"". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.\n\nTasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\n\n- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier

Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \""Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\"" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. \""Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.\"" After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. \""I'll bring your carrier back out in a minute.\"" We said no, that's okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \""Would you like a moment before I take him?\"" No \""I'm sorry.\"" Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. \n\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy.

Also, the desserts are mandatory!  \n\nThe duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.

When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu [[really]] jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I [[had]] planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- [[so]] great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us [[immediately]].  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost [[immediately]] and we were [[offered]] another basket as soon as we [[finished]] the first. The bread came with a delicious [[spread]] - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was [[promptly]] replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could [[try]] the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight [[dishes]] [[disappointed]]! The first courses were Sea [[Scallops]] & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!

My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is dressy, but the restaurant isn't so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable, which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.\n\nOur waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.\n\nFollowing the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.\n\nI'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food.

It seems like every other time I take my pets to Point Breeze there is an unnecessary frustration.   From being berating for using their online prescription program to being misquoted prices substantially to poor customer service I just keep hoping each time will be better.  Although I know they love animals I suspect they love money more.  Dr. Caroline. Simard is an excellent vet, but my last two visits have been pushed to other vets whose bedside manner is atrocious.   I'm a 40 year-old  who has been taking my pets to vets since childhood and I don't understand why each visit leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is [[vast]], and the price is [[right]]. They have so many different things to try, it's [[nearly]] impossible to choose. I'm a big fan of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here.

It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're [[going]] to [[offer]] the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the [[seasons]] and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason. \n\nBeware, they only accept cash. But there is an ATM on site!

The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \""get together\"" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!

What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \n\""Would you care for some dessert?\"", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.

Love this place! I was visiting Pittsburgh from Houston and we decided to finish off our visit with this museum - or should I say museums. Coming from Houston where we have some pretty good museums, this was a pleasant surprise - really cheap considering you get both Art and Natural History.\nThe dinosaur exhibit was so interesting and educational.  The gem and mineral exhibit was huge. And the art museum had a surprisingly awesome collection - I was thrilled to see a couple Van Goghs, Monets, Cezannes, etc.\nThe only exhibit I didn't much care for was the temporary art exhbit - some contemporary craziness that involved body parts dangling from the ceiling.. at least it gave us something to talk about.\nAll in all I did not spend nearly as much time here as I could have and would have liked. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting Pittsburgh.

Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.

I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.

Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""what's going on here\"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""Uh-oh\"".  The menu is huge with a number of \""slow-food\"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""bacon\"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""meat\"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.

Review #200\n\nI got hooked on this bakery while living in Brighton Heights.  Now, when I drive past, I HAVE to stop.  I think this one is so much better than the sister store in West View.  I don't know why; I just like it better.\n\nThe sweetest ladies run this local bakery, and they always serve with a smile.  It's usually pretty fast too!  And they're CHEAP.  Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.  Some favorites:\n\nAll of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake, cream or jelly, chocolate or vanilla, they're ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can't.  The selection here doesn't go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time, but if you want options, go early.\n\nLemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick, but they're so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.\n\nThumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie, but I really like them here too!\n\nIs the cliental a little special sometimes?  You bet.  Are the hours old fashioned early to open and early to close?  Yup.  But I just view it as absence makes the heart grow fonder.... :)

Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or \""PAT\"") operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail. Instead of running school buses, the school district gave [[high]] schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've [[had]] a [[great]] experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\""Miss Pat\""--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation.

Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or \""PAT\"") operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail. Instead of running school buses, the school district gave [[high-pitched]] schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've [[suffer]] a [[large]] experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\""Miss Pat\""--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go.

I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha.

It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't good. \n\nAs soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated. On one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working, and one of them was pregnant. You can imagine the chaos. I wanted to have this \""Pittsburgh\"" experience that I've heard so much about but honestly I was more than underwhelmed. \n\nAfter being seated, it took the waitress 10 minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there.\n\nThe sandwich at best was mediocre. The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich. I needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich. Not to mention I got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards. \n\nIf you're a tourist, go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the \""Pittsburgh\"" experience. Apart from that, I don't know why you'd return.

That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\n\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \n\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.

Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""bacon\"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.

The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!\n\nAnd it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off.

I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

If 0 stars were possible I'd give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill. \n\nI didn't even touch the anemic, yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them, more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent, but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.\n\nSpeaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.\n\nThis guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??! \n\nWorst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest. \n\nI'd suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there!

Sorry, but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all, there was no lid on the salad, it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it, I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage.

The Sicilian Pizza is huge, tasty, crusty on the outside, soft in the middle.  The regular thin crust pizza was loaded with toppings.\n\nMy only complaint is that the Pizza was served luke warm.  I want my pizza piping hot, almost burning the roof of my mouth!\n\nThe overall taste made up for the temperature difference, and I was happy with the overall experience.

I can't [[believe]] this [[place]] [[got]] a bad rating!!!

I [[want]] everyone to [[disregard]] the [[previous]] bad rating about this [[place]]. \nI live about a block [[away]] from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I [[went]] in, I [[noticed]] that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, [[trust]] me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never [[had]] to [[wait]] more than a few minutes. \nThe food is [[absolutely]] [[amazing]]!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's [[amazingly]] [[filling]]. \nI [[always]] [[get]] the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \""unsavories\"" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!

Really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting.  The gift shop is one of the best in the city.  They feature crafts from artists around the world and local.  Shows are well lit and well presented.  Downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals, wood, fiber, mixed media and book/paper arts (beginning to advanced).

Came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building. No host/ess, no wandering servers, no customers... We had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of off-duty servers who were rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us. It took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out. To make everything worse, the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food. The server returned to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that \""the manager\"" told him that since the food is made early in the day, it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served. WHAT? Seriously???? It was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived.\n\nThe food left much the be desired. The service was the worst I've ever encountered. I don't usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but I had to leave one for this terrible visit. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. Needless to say we did not return to redeem it.

The [[steaks]] here are very [[good]].  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.

The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river, and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However, the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here, whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening, or a slow weekday afternoon, the service has been poor. The food is average, and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich. \n\nRedfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant!

4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them.

When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it, she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then she stared at me.

However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis.

If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle.

All the staff were friendly and everything was easy, from check-in to check-out. \n\nThe rooms have high ceilings and were nicely furnished, and the 3rd floor courtyard even had its own bbq for guest use, which seemed like a nice thought. \n\nI'd stay there again for sure.

My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple [[nights]] and wanted to [[have]] a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we [[went]] into that night. (we didn't even [[have]] a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would [[probably]] go somewhere else. But if you just [[want]] to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the [[place]]!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both [[quite]] [[capable]] but Jeff was [[amazing]] at [[making]] us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. [[Even]] then, he [[made]] sure we were taken care of.

Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile .

Ok, but they do not go out of their way to help! I didn't have a credit card so at first they said I couldn't check in. Finally they allowed me to put down cash. Then I went to breakfast, and the shuttle refused to pick us up because \""roads were too bad\"" We waited for 45 minutes at the restaurant. No cabs could pick us up, so I called the hotel and explained our situation (had to get to work soon, 5 mth pregnant woman with me, only a mile and a half away). He said he couldn't help. We had to walk while the snow blew in our faces. When we were almost there, we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it, driving in the opposite direction, away from us. I cannot believe how rude they were

I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)

Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill.

Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water, when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don't have coke, would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn't we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don't go here.  If I could rate this a zero, I would.

We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.

My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already [[had]] dinner [[reservations]] and [[show]] tickets, we just [[had]] to [[find]] a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we [[had]] [[show]] tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was [[finishing]]. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony [[threw]] flower petals upon the couple. The hotel [[handled]] those like myself who were not [[part]] of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not [[be]] disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to [[meet]] our dinner [[reservation]] while I checked into the hotel. I was [[able]] to [[take]] the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a [[couple]] blocks away without even being late. I [[really]] liked the makeup mirror since I [[have]] to [[take]] off my glasses to [[apply]] my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and [[enjoyed]] our show. We [[got]] out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.

First of all, a disclaimer. The only thing I have ever ordered here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam [[eating]] Pho on an almost-daily [[basis]], and now it is my comfort food, what I [[want]] when I am sick, tired, or [[sad]].\nThat [[said]], I can recommend the Pho [[Tai]] without [[hesitation]]. Out of the 3 Vietnamese [[restaurants]] I [[have]] been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this [[has]] the [[best]] pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory. \nI both [[eaten]] in here and [[gotten]] take-out. [[Eating]] in is a pleasant [[experience]].

I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a \""lemon\"" of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \""meat,\"" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \""amazing.\""  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades.

A year later, prices have increased 70% and the quality of food have declined. Customer service is still superb though. Today, I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps, 25% beef in dish only, there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish, and was drenched in oil. Another dish, red curry with chicken, was always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality, which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad. Sad to say, this used to be my favorite place, but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another Thai place to be our go-to.

I really don't understand the hype of this place. To be honest, had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city, then I would have probably rated it a 3 or 4. The pizza was just OK. It was decently greasy and the crust wasn't all that special. They wouldn't deliver (Even though I am literally a few blocks from them) and they don't accept credit / debit card - a huge downfall for me.

I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.

Stopped by last week.  Store was going to close for a couple of weeks for remodel and I think a cafe will be put in the front.  \n\nThe pita bread is made fresh daily as are many of the other prepared foods.  You can watch the pita being made thru the window in the bakery.  The pita is wonderful and you can pick up so many delicious Mediterranean food items to take home.  Olive oil, olives, cheeses, Hoummus Dip, Baba Ghannouj, deserts, Halva, Specialty Pita Pies.  \n\nGood food and friendly service.

This place has the best pizza I've ever had besides Keste and Paulie Gs in NYC.  Wood fired greatness.  Expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar.  FANTASTIC red sauce and olive oil.  Not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection. A gem in Pittsburgh.

Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly, around 7:10pm. For the first time ever, the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc\u00e9 in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a \""Hello\"" from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never received great service here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.\n\nP.S. I ordered a Diet Coke, and received a glass of what seems to be Robitussin. That, or there's alcohol in this drink. Either case, I'm not thrilled.

I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small, the place is small, and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute, but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good, the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good, but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it, as they use think rice instead of noodles, but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall, not impressed. I probably won't return.

Rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren't sure if children or non-locals were not appreciated.  We walked into a virtually empty restaurant at 6 on a Monday; got the once over; and the hostess said \""i hope you have a reservation.  We have a big crowd at 6:30. You can wait for 45 minutes at the wine bar.\"" We walked outside and easily booked a reservation on Open Table for 6:15, so we walked back in and were seated right away.  \n\nFood was ok--puttanesca tasted like yellow mustard but caprese was awesome.  We repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though.  I should mention that when we arrived a family with small children were leaving after finishing their meal and they had a stock-pile of high chairs in plain view, so it was not unreasonable to bring our well-behaved girls (6 and 2 yrs old).  By 6:30, there were still a number of empty tables.\n\nIf you're not from Pittsburgh, there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children, I would avoid this place.

I came here craving some sushi.  Looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant.  I was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and I love supporting small mom and pops.  \n\nI figured this may be a little diamond in the rough.  Man, was I wrong.  The sushi was not fresh.  The sushi wasn't rolled tight either.  The rice didn't have the trademark sushi rice flavor. \n\nSpoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of California, I felt like the ingredients were sort of old.  Considering I went in on a Saturday, I figured it might be better but it wasn't at all.\n\nThe service was good.  That's the justification for the 2 stars.  Otherwise, I really wouldn't recommend this place to other people.

Worst experience with a hairdresser ever, at this location. Made an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said \""You get body waves?\"" Yeah, that's why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim, I wanted after she wanted before, and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter, but FIRST telling me the perm \""wouldn't soak in\"" on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It's taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better, but finally agreed. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair, from the forehead back, scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn't enough, though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left. When I addressed the problem at the front, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner. Yeah. Right. THAT'S gonna happen.

It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.\[[northward]]\nShe return 5 [[min]] later with another round of [[beverage]] which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even [[inquire]] one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?

Since my return to Pittsburgh, [[I]] have been to the \""new\"" Elbow Room several times.

Honestly, there were 5 people in the restaurant.  It took forever for food to [[arrive]] at our table.  Could it be attributed to the fact that I was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they aren't sufficiently staffed?  I don't know.

Probably should have gotten a salad.  \n\nI'm hoping that I just caught them on a [[bad]] afternoon.

Overall a decent yet confusing experience...\nPros: it's like living in an apt. because it's spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs. There's even free laundry soap available in the laundry room. It's located next to a lot of restaurants and shops. Some of the staff has been friendly in providing things, including shuttle rides.\nCons: Extremely inconsistent room cleaning service! If you're staying for an extended period of time, they only clean your room once a week on an assigned day. The problem is, they don't show on the assigned day to clean. My roommate and I have ended up calling the office, sometimes twice before it's cleaned. Also, someone in our  building had $1,900 stolen out of her drawer, and the management told her not to call the cops. They ended up cutting her check, but not before a lot of stern talk. I wouldn't stay here again...if you do, make sure that you use the safe provided in the room, and expect to do a lot of the maid services yourself.

I don't know how this place has stayed in business for so long.  It has never appealed to me, yet some family member drags me there every five years or so.  It never changes. It seems like an independently owned Chili's.  The menu is boring.  The food nothing special.  \n\nMost recently, I ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didn't have anything except for some super spongy Italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread.  My beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked.  Grapefruit segments were all membrane.  Lettuce was ice cold, nearly frozen.  \n\nSee you in another five years.

I got a groupon for Dean of Shadyside for hairline highlights, deep conditioning masque, and a hair cut for $35.  I had never been, but I gave it a try.  The groupon was for a level 1 stylist, and I had Erika.  She was pretty great!  I've never had highlights before, and she helped me figure out what would look good.  My highlights look great, the cut looks great, she did exactly what I wanted her to do!  I never make hair appointments far in advance, but I pre-booked my next appointment!!!  I would highly recommend this place, and I recommend Erika as well!

I hate to put two stars, but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.\n\nThere were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.\n\nI had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.\n\nIf the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars. As it is, I wish I'd gone somewhere else. Clearly, other people love the place. Maybe I'll give it another chance, if I'm with friends who want to go.

I never really understood why Doc's was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise, the prices suck (beer served in 10 ounce cups on special for $2.50 - come on), the food is mediocre, and the atmosphere is nonexistent.  The drinks are weak as well.  \n\nIf you're looking for a night out, there are better places close by in Shadyside.  The deck really is nice, but it doesn't help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks, especially for what you get.  That being said, I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I'm missing something.

Let me [[start]] by saying I was [[given]] a coupon for a [[free]] haircut and mani.  You [[have]] to [[really]] [[let]] me down with free to get a two-star review.\n\nTHE HAIRCUT.\n Let's put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it, I was really happy with it.  I really liked the girl I had.  I thought that she [[cut]] it just how I wanted.  [[But]] then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it, and I [[said]] no thanks because I have wavy hair that's pretty easy to [[make]] fancy (read: easy as in I don't [[use]] products or heat almost ever, thanks) even though it's quite long.  Somehow, she made my wash 'n wear waves into a frizzy stuff [[hot]] [[mess]] with some combination of gels and spray.  Then, she [[told]] me she was [[going]] to dry my hair to [[90]]% dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me [[later]].  Okayyyyyy.  Overall, haircut & style = 3 stars.\n\nTHE MANI\nThis mani brought down the average rating of my visit as I'd [[give]] it one star.  I haven't gotten a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it!  Seriously, get some bleach.  Then I figured out what the stains were...the girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn't happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon, I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was, she didn't know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.\n\nI actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn't want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.\n\nSummary: Free isn't great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish.

My girlfriend [[has]] been a regular of this place for [[years]] and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers [[game]]. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully [[expecting]] a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""list\"". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to [[scream]] at her for several minutes. The entire [[restaurant]] went [[quiet]] and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""out of towners\"" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.

Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch, it needs to not only be good, but also unique. Unfortunately, Pamela's is neither of these things.

They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said \""Oh hi, we're showing the apartment\"", and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is totally invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible.

I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of [[okay]].\n\nThe positives: \n\nThe vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nDim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.\n\nThe only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.\n\nThe food is only okay.  \n\nAll in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place.

I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place.

Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how [[I]] [[learned]] about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we [[went]] out foraging for breakfast, but before [[I]] did, I [[did]] a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as [[soon]] as I [[saw]] the reviews. \n\nThere were about 15 people hovering outside [[so]] went in to [[put]] our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to [[put]] our [[names]] down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a [[bit]] rude. \n\nThe seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing [[varieties]] of art (some for sale, no less). \n\nThe menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We [[went]] with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I [[really]] [[wanted]] to and [[tried]] to [[finish]] mine, but I just couldn't man up. \n\nThe other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage [[boys]] next to [[use]] who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while. \n\nI think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's.

Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious, and I'm freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like!  My flatbread was smothered in them, just the way I like it.  The sashimi was nothing [[crazy]], I liked the grilled pineapple with it.  \n\nMy husband got himself a burger, the barbecue one, to be exact, and I had the wild mushroom pasta.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread, but the server [[raved]] about it, so I tried it anyway.  \n\nMy husband [[enjoyed]] his burger, though he thought it could have been less salted.  He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.\n\n The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed [[kinda]] squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.\n\nThe pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got \""al dente\"" right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.\n\nOverall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree.

I am a nice, amicable person. I treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude. I rarely complain about things. Thus, it makes me sad to write a negative review. However, the way in which Mozart Management Staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was in graduate school. We loved our tiny, cute apartment at Schenley Arms, our first home as a couple. This abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression, irritability and statements such as \""we have never had a complaint before\"" and \""we cannot accommodate your schedule\"". I felt guilty at first about calling, but then had an epiphany and realized that Mozart has serious issues. The tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating, demeaning and threatening. I will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist. What ever happened to customer service, decency and basic regard for other human beings?    \n       If you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlord..AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Also, there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on Google..READ AND BELIEVE THEM. They are completely mean and disrespectful. This is not the kind of business I want to support, as it conflicts with my value system. We are moving out ASAP when our lease expires. \n\nPS the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve 5 stars! I hope they aren't treated as bad as the tenants.

This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK, it was thawed, but had previously been frozen) corn, about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta. As a vegetarian, this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal. What a disappointment - I won't be back.

Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .\n\nI think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.\n\nThe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \""how's it going\"", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. \n\nThe portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \""busy\"", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.

We [[went]] to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the food was great; quality was adequate. Service was abysmal. Just as an [[example]], our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. Never [[received]] a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time, either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.\n\nAs far as the food went, it was good - I had the Admiral's Feast, which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up.\n\nI just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.\n\nAs far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward.

Will never come here again!\n\nMy cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds. We came to this CVS location because it was after hours and the CVS I usually go to in Matthews wasn't going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed, so we drove 30 minutes in the opposite direction to this location in Huntersville.\n\nWhen we walked in around 10PM on a Friday, the place was packed to the brim. All the exam rooms were full and there were about 10 people in the lobby. Okay, so maybe that night we just had bad luck?\n\nNo. Our greeting at the front desk was awful. The secretary didn't even make eye contact with us and acted like we were inconveniencing her. She was appalling and rude. \n\nWe were told we would have to wait at least an hour because they were overly busy, which we understood. After a couple hours, we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the ICU for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision.  Well, the secretary didn't even come relay the NO response to us.\n\nLuckily, not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary. But we ended up waiting over 5 hours (until 3:30AM), only to be told that they were admitting her into the ICU overnight and running tests (exactly as we requested before). I know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left, but we felt that common sense wasn't being put to use at this facility.

Took it back 5 days later because one of the buttons didn't work, and they refuse to take it back claiming i dropped and damaged it.

Food was ok. It wasn't bad, just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute, but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember

Being a previous server myself, I can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night. However, this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and I the entire time.

I tried to take a item back with the packing slip that came on the item, the associate told me I was unable to do the return with the packing slip but she could do it if I had the email confirmation.. I didn't have it on my phone so I went.. I found the email sent it back to my phone and tried the return again.. todays associate told me I could not do the return with the confirmation email but needed the packing slip.. which I could not find at the time. I asked to speak with the manager on duty which the associate called.. Valencia the manager on duty would not come up to speak with me but told the associate that they couldn't do the return..

Stay away from this AAMCO! They have the worst customer service EVER! \nWe purchased a Groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed, made an appointment and showed up 10 minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind. I even called before I went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe I cold get in and out earlier. The person who answered the phone, Tasha, didn't say anything about them being behind. Had she said so, I would have waited 45 minutes before going there. Turns out I sat there for almost 3 hours! NOT GOOD! Then when it was time for me to check out, she tried to charge me $3.52  for 'shop materials'. Well, I happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesn't cost $3.52.

Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.

Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.   \n\nTucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and [[twinkling]] lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  \n\nI was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  [[Great]] beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to [[get]] the \""what it is.\""  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!\n\nWhile the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure.

I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was [[ok]] as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \""crab\"" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon.

We had To ask for everything numerous of times. Service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly. I personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making. I hated to make so many complaints but I've never experienced such horrible service. It was awful We couldn't find any positive in it. As a matter of fact the waitress didn't even come back to pick up all the checks. It Was 7 of us and 6 ppl got their checks.

First time here , only thing nice about this place is the location. The food from the frozen baked wings , bland Mac and cheese , tasteless stuffed brisket burger , and let's not forget the pepperoni pizza that Sam's food club can do better . This has to be the worse bar food for game watching in Charlotte, NC .

The beer was pretty good, but the food was a real disappointment.\nI have always enjoyed the beer at Rock Bottom and miss their location in Atlanta (Buckhead).\nWe sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp.\nI had the pizza and it was mediocre at best.  The wings were fine, but nothing special.  The restaurant was busy, but wasn't packed.   Our food took a long time to come out.  We were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for 15 minutes.  It seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough, but the servers weren't getting the food to the tables.

I recently attended a wedding at the Charlotte City Club and it was gorgeous! Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view, but the meal was high-quality (hands down the best macaroni and cheese on the planet). It was definitely one of the best dinners I've had at a wedding. They also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent.\n\nReason for 4 stars?  I wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiff-overly so. I had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times.  Also, the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band. For that reason I would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception, but over-all it was a very beautiful space.

That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.

I'm visiting Charlotte for work and found this place through restaurant.com.  I'm glad I did!\n\nI went with a friend from the area who was a little weary about its location but was pleasantly surprised by the inside.  It's cute and quaint with a touch of modern flair.  We each started with a martini as they are all $4 dollars on Thursdays (normally $7-9).  The waters didn't actually come until after the martinis which is a little backwards, but the martinis were welcomed with open arms - and were yummy!  The food came out quickly and hot... I ordered the pasta primavera with creamy pesto and added shrimp.  It was nicely flavored, it was chalk full of goodies and the portion was more than enough.  I was disappointed that I didn't have a fridge in my hotel to take home the leftovers!  My friend ordered the grits.  Definitely a good dish but I would not recommend it to those who don't like spicy food because it had quite a cajun kick.\n\nAll in all a good experience.  Check it out!

Time Warner Cable is an incompetent company that runs a monopoly on internet services in certain neighborhoods.  They will enroll you in bill pay, then charge you late fees when their service fails to draw funds.  Not failure to draw funds from a lack of cash in the account.  No, this is a failure to draw funds because their billing department is complete and utter garbage.  Their services are sub par and they over charge for this shit service because as previously stated they run the only line available for entire neighborhoods and small towns through out the Charlotte area.

The technician (a very nice guy) advised me to purchase my own router, which I did. When I called Time Warner to register the IP, I was informed that there is a separate $7 a month fee to use your own router.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE COMPANY.

I've gotten massages from Modern Salon several times, and loved them all there... until the last time, when I lost my penchant- after learning the masseuse I had used before, no longer worked there. His replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when I came in! It wasn't until after I already paid for the service, gave her a tip and went home, that I started thinking in retrospect... then got mad that I actually paid for something that made me feel WORSE. It was some time ago, so I will have to call them to see if her name's on record, so I can recommend not using her. I don't think she listened to a word I said. I had the 1-hour massage, and I explained to her before hand, that I wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back & neck, because I had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer 24/7 until finishing a job that week. I also told her I prefer harder pressure. I have never had a \""massage\"" like that before. She did nothing but tickle me. I told her at least twice that she can use more pressure, but I guess she didn't care... then she ends up paying the LEAST amount of attention to my problem areas I asked her to focus on. I guess I was being too nice? I should have asked for someone else, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nI haven't had a massage there since then, but I love getting my haircuts there. I've had a few different stylists, but loved each one. They were especially helpful when I had to undergo chemotherapy treatments, which made me lose all of my hair. When it finally started growing back in, it was a mess... they helped my hair to look & feel so much better and healthier. \n\nThe staff are all friendly and pleasant. The spa (upstairs) is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers. The spa's waiting area is comfy and quiet, and the dressing rooms/showers/sauna room is nice, and offers a nice assortment of Aveda products to test out.

I totally agree with you that Time Warner Cable has one of the worst customer service I have come across.  Sorry for the comment.  They may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job.\n\nI signed up as they knocked at my door.  Like someone said, we need internet nowadays.  We need cable TV in order we can get national or world news, more informatory program or some quality programs.  They were fast to install for you.  But when you do not have service, it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone or they hanged you up after waiting forever.\n\nHowever when I wanted to seek their help, they would not answer you without a pin and kept transfer you to so many departments (really that big, I don't know) till your phone call dropped.  That will take you hours on the phone without a solution.\n\nAs I need to move and cancel the account, they will give you a hard time.  Watch out this company.

I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all.

However, even though the line was long it [[moves]] smoothly and didn't [[take]] too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line.

[[Cool]] restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife, dad, and grandpa, while paying a little visit to Charlotte.  My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was excellent - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans.  The pulled pork was a little stringy and very vinegary, but unique.  \n\nWife got the salmon cakes and I didn't really care for them.  I told her she shouldn't have ordered that, but oh well.  Her mac and cheese was great though.  My grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked great and he really enjoyed it.  I tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy.  I don't remember what my dad ordered...\n\nI like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and they're all soul food-type items.  We have tons of good restaurants in Southern California, but nothing like Mert's.  If I came back, I'd probably order the fried chicken, or the catfish if I'm feeling exotic.

Taking in a Surprise \n\nTaking a light outdoor walk from Camden Southend to the streets of uptown Charlotte sure makes one hungry. The first place that caught my eye was a resilient green light coming off South Tryon. It was so bright it was reflecting off the mirror statue at the Betchlor Museum across the street. The next thing I know I am staring the menu at the best table in the house. (If you have ever walked past this place you know what table it is.) The light music and privacy of the booth makes for intimate conversation and romantic situations. The comfortable and spacious booth allows you to play footsy all night without hurting yourself. \n\nI had the mussels which were Euphoric. Cooked in some type of wine, butter, and cream which happen to be DAMN good when mixed together. My palate was very pleased and upset at the same time. Pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face, but upset when the last empty shell fell with the others. Happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste I could only once wonder about I got myself the check. I didn't care how much it was, it was good, the service was astounding, and I was so comfortable at this point I could not even set a price on this kind of experience. Popped it open and to my surprise I walked out of there paying less than $100 for two people+Wines +Appitizers+Desserts. \n\nAfter stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma I gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself I'll be back here before I know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds.

The worst customer service by server and manager. We've been coming here for years. Tonight's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine, I understand it happens sometimes. However while waiting two hours, we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner. We got the same response every time. \""It'll be right up.\"" He did not\nconsider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times. \n\nAfter I stopped asking nicely about our food, the server finally went to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come. \n\nThe server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated.

****** 4.5 stars *****\n\nOne of the few places where I can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please. Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original \""great\"" restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.\n\nI really like the \""upscale Southern\"" idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa does. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.\n\nWhether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here!

I don't much like the look of this place - I never would [[have]] ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty [[good]] pizza.  \n\nI have [[eaten]] [[trillions]] of pizzas.  [[Maybe]] more, I [[lost]] count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on deep dish, pan, and thin crust [[pizzas]].  I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for [[kicks]].  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a [[little]] better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and [[change]] the flour blend so that there's a [[crispness]] to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \""if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\""  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie.

What the hell, Phil's Tavern? Every time I come here (usually before a show), things just don't work out. I wanted them to, but they just didn't.\n\nFOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry. \n\nDRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The dirty martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a warm Corona? Do not want.\n\nSERVICE: Nice, but few and far between.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Dank, dirty, sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.\n\nOverall: \nDon't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area, I just need to find them.

I have had the baked Chicken (Thursday special) and it is WONDERFUL!. A great change from all the chain and fast food restaurants downtown. It does get very crowded and little awkward when it is that way. \nThe food comes fast and is delicious. I have only been here for weekday lunches, usually Thursday. My coworkers love the other specials too. \nIf you are looking for a change from the everyday, this place is a great one to start!

GROSS! \nI can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would be great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...\n\nwe took pictures of how disgusting the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. \nThere is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.\nWe had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God! \nThe front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged, you have to walk by them any time you leave your room. The whole experience was awful and uncomfortable.\nI am going to post the pics

Bleah!!!  I went here because I was staying at the Westin across the street.  We had about 12 people for dinner.  The decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired.  I started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering I ordered it by number.  The waiter had all the personality of a rock.  Ok no biggie, but then came the food.  I ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli.  The food came out at different times which left some of our food getting cold.  When my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some really bad sauce on it that I can't explain.  It was pretty unedible after a couple of bites.  Also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed(?) definatly not as described on the menu.   All in all I would skip this place, the food is bad, one star for the decour and wine list , but they even managed to screw up the wine order.

AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!\n\nOur dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.\n\nI ordered what the waiter claimed was their \""signature\"" dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had \""re-heated\"" it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he \""saw\"" the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 1/3.\n\nWe told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.\n\nThe following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as \""Aquavina\"".  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!

I used to love this restaurant and have brought out of town guest there for dinner in the past years but this restaurant has gone downhill and should no longer be in business.  My last visit was at lunch with other work colleagues a couple of weeks ago.  I ordered Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  When it arrived, it was pretty obvious that the Ahi Tuna was old and on its way to being rancid.  I was appalled that any real Chef would ever serve anything that looked that bad.  I was in a business setting where I did not want to make a scene so I ate only the vegetables and did not touch the Tuna for fear of getting sick.  The waitress never ask me if there was anything wrong with my dish even though it should have been obvious to her that I pretty much left the fish untouched.  If you're Uptown, do yourself a favor and go to Halcyon, Mimosa Grille, Ruth Chris or Bernardin before going here for lunch.

ZERO stars for this guy.  I called because we had a flood in our home, but when the floors were ripped up, the water mitigator said we had a problem with our dishwasher and needed to have it checked for leaks.  My home warranty company gave me the number to Carolina Appliance Service.  I left a message and got a call back right away.  When I told the guy my situation, he stopped me and said he was NOT interested in working with me because he was worried that if he did a bad job the insurance company would be coming after him.  He actually started an argument with me.  I assume he was the owner because he said \""my company\"".  But my simple question was 'Isn't that what you do?  Fix dishwashers?'...why is this company even on my home warranty's list of providers.  He argues so much that I didn't even get to tell him this wasn't part of an insurance claim.  So to recap...very rude, with obviously NO CONFIDENCE in his own work.  Don't call these guys.

This is the worst Chinese restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  I went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed.  I don't write many reviews, but I didn't want someone to get suckered in like I did.  \n\nThe one good thing that I will say about this restaurant was that the food was very cheap.  However, I could not stomach but a few bites so I still did not get my money's worth.

This place is ok. The people who work there are amazing though. They love what they do and they enjoy helping you. They have a great comic book selection however, I wish they carried more toys. \n\nSadly, this placed is owned by a guy who only cares about profit and not customer service. Kind of a jerk.

Best place in Charlotte for comics, hands down. Sadly, not the best place to go for a friendly staff. Condescending tones and mockery of things I asked for/was inquiring about are not a good way to get return business! :( I'll buy online before I go in here again.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this place.  Seeing some of the patrons walking into this place dressed up and at the same time seeing a giant alligator statue sitting in a throne in the front yard.  Once inside it's actually a really nice place.  The service is great, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive and really cared that we had a good time.  There is live music on some nights which always makes for a good time.  Looking at the other reviews, I think the food is kind of hit or miss.

So earlier this year I bought a coupon off of Google Offers for Cajun Queen. I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try. \n\nThe atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon. \n\nService was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory. \n\nAll in all, the trip was worth it, but with the coupon. I would have kicked myself if I had to pay full price for the experience received. That being said, I doubt I will be returning on my own accord.

It's a nice airport to have a layover in. Free wifi is only for 45 minutes but there are tons of [[eateries]], shopping and even a spa. \nThe only thing that sucks is if you have a short layover and have to run from one end of the airport to the other to make your plane.

Though the Freedom Dr. K-Mart looks like the setting of a post-apocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime, you can find some 'trinkets' for cheap on the inside.  \n\nThis K-Mart has some affordable home furninishing knock-offs (by cheap, I mean cheaper than Target/IKEA).  While it some of it is dated, K-Mart still carries the much-touted Martha Stewart brands.  I've found a 'runner' rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores.  The same can be said for the furniture, so don't hate on my stylish house. \n\nThe clothing department is slightly dicier, but I have scavenged some faddish clothes (think Gap 3 years ago) among the Big Bubba t-shirts and overalls.  Their young men's section has good deals at the end of the season, like utility shirts or those really metrosexual boot-cut jeans for less than $15.  Yeah....really.\n\nThe rest of the store is pretty much filler.  If you actually go to this K-Mart ( or any K-Mart) looking for a decent selection of sporting goods/shoes/electronics, you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection.  If you're like me and approach K-Mart shopping like thrift store diving, you will be pleasantly surprised. Can't decide then if visiting K-Mart is frugal or frivolous, but who doesn't need another cheap belt?

Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (\""US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT\"").  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.  \n\nI might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.

By far the best attraction was the plane that was in route to Charlotte and landed on the Hudson. After seeing the damages and reading the stories this was nothing short of a miracle. \n\nAnother really cool feature is that they have preserved personal items from the passengers and flight crew which is a really nice touch.

I have visited Harper's a few times in the past two years. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The atmosphere is warm and personable, which is nice for couples and families.\n\nBut with each experience, I am less impressed. The food is good. However, there are better places to dine within the Southpark area. The food is moderately priced, but is too much for what you get. My last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu. The offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty. I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I would have been happier visiting The Cheesecake Factory located across the street from Harper's which has many more menu options.\n\nI am sad to say that I will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here.  : /

I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte, so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.\n\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you.

Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza, so we found Musashi. I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back.

The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.

Red alert. Red Alert. \n\nIf you are looking for good mobile phone customer service, this is not the store. I'm changing my provider to Verizon or AT&T after the experience I had last night. Here's how it went down....\n\nI headed in around 6:30pm as my contract expired so I needed to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years. When I entered, I noticed around eight employees out front and three in the back...so I thought to myself, this won't take long, there are a ton of people working. I signed in with the \""receptionist\"" who told me the wait to buy a new phone would be 10 minutes. No biggie, I told her, I'll just go check out all the gadgets. \n\nForty minutes later I was still waiting - and showing as third on the list for service. Now this wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front. I literally timed two people between customers - one waited over 15 minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasn't helping anyone when I left and it had been 20 minutes since his last customer. \n\nNeedless to say, I left the store...but not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didn't have to wait even longer. I will not be back and have been researching other providers today.

Gross, what happened?! It has been a while since I have been to PF Chang's. It used to be one of my favorites...I remember going to a conference and I ate at the PF Chang's across the street from my hotel every day. \n\nThis last time there was pure disappointment. From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah. The service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed. Made for a very unenjoyable experience. \n\nBlah...and I'm sad that it wasn't better.

Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.

While there were no insect carcasses in my food, I was still not very impressed with my meal at PF Chang's.  I went for a \""business lunch\"" with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!\n\nI got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \n\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice.

I've only been here 2x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure. The first time was okay, but the nail tech was rather snotty and had attitude the entire time. PLEASE, if you are offering \""discount\"" for customers paying in cash you have no reason to be a snot! Give me a break! The 2nd time I had the same snotty tech and she was just as expected-snotty! The pedicure was a joke and they basically do a quick rub and no true callus removal at all. The dryers they use for the gel manicure are old and trashy and have a handmade taped cardboard piece in the middle of it to help you place your hands correctly so that the gel actually adheres. Well guess what, it didn't work and my thumbs were actually chipping the next day when a gel manicure should last 1.5-2 weeks. It wasn't worth dealing with them to go back and have it fixed so instead I'll just let everyone know not to go there and instead go elsewhere.

Upstream is tres chic! I've been there multiple times and service has always been impeccable.

Their brunch is a tad on the high side ($25 I believe) but completely worth it just for a bite of the Brioche French Toast alone.  Along with that I've gone there for Thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it. They have a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children . To top it all off, they are a part of Harpers restaurant group and offer cooking classes on Saturdays for $35/class (a few of the classes go for $55 or $60)

Each game is about fifteen minutes long and the setup is fairly large, with many areas to run around and attack friends.  Bring your childhood self here for a good clean time!

We [[took]] my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in [[March]]. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a [[extended]] warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a [[bad]] replacement control unit. They [[ordered]] a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to [[get]] Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module [[had]] [[burned]] the other two out. They [[had]] it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.

\""The little hippie food market that could\"" seems so out of place in the \""corridor of crap\"" that is Independence Boulevard, but I gotta tell 'ya this store is amazing for just about any special dietary need.\n\nThe star of this market is the aisle-long bulk foods section that puts anything at our other local grocery stores to shame.  Whether you need dried fruits, spices, or nuts or grains (even candies), I'm pretty sure they have it here, and also have it as an organic option.  You get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout.\n\nThey also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too.  Again, you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrient/supplement your heart desires.  Big selection of incense and candles too.\n\nIf you have gluten allergies, this ought to be your go-to, they have a bigger selection than I have seen just about anywhere else.  Also, vegetarian/vegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too.  They have a fresh produce section that is small, but can do in a pinch- same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods.  I'd still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items, however.\n\nI have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowded-feeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown (like most of its neighboring businesses) which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town.  Still, the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached.  I still don't know why they put this store where it is, but I'm not going to complain because I'm glad it's there.

I ordered General Tso's chicken and beef fried rice and both were vastly sub-par. The chicken was tangy and had an off taste. The rice was soggy and the beef was over cooked.

What a lousy experience.  Perhaps there was a reason they were so unprepared but as a regular Hertz Gold customer I was astonished at the disorganization of this facility. Last Thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers, many Gold got off the bus to find their name not on the Gold sign, so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside (gold office too small for more than 3-4 people) to wait for ONE person to find us cars.  Finally after 20 mins a second person came to help  After a significant wait I was asked if I really needed a full-sized car as requested.  Since it was apparent something else would be quicker I took what they offered (of course smaller not more luxurious). The car was fine - however, the return experience on Friday afternoon was just as miserable - perhaps more so since I was now running late for my flight. \n\nFirst of all, CLT airport you need a traffic light at the intersection Near the  Hertz return entrance - it took about 15 mins to get across the street -thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross. \n\nAnd then, we waited another 15 mins for a bus to take us to the terminal - bad planning Hertz. If I didn't have TSA per-check Or had to check a bag, I'm not sure I would have made my flight. \n\nTotally unacceptable service - that's an oxymoron with Hertz Charlotte.

I however made the mistake of staying. I purchased the beef teriyaki combo (which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after I waited for my food for 20 mins).

The chicken was so dry, hard and overcooked it was like chicken jerky & didn't even taste anything like it should.  We were so disappointed so he called to tell the manager and she didn't offer us a better one or anything free next time.  It was just a waste of $10 because we couldn't eat it.

So, I had to play hotel switcheroo because Hyatt's rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay. I wound up here and I think I'm officially done with Choice Hotels forever. I've never had a positive experience aside from this one Econo Lodge in Walterboro, SC.\n\nThis hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants. If you want to go to a grocery store, they're all 15 minutes away. While the hotel might be convenient to some attractions, it isn't convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like McDonald's and Waffle House. Gross.\n\nThe beds are not comfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square 15\"" pillows. Who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child!? It's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on. Pair the lack of comfort with the 11:00 check out and you have one unhappy guest! I requested a late check-out time upon check-in as I advised I'd be working overnight. 12:30 was the best she could do as she made some kind of, apparently phantom note. The next morning at exactly 10:58, the phone rang and reminded me that I was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was 11:00. Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.\n\nThe hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.\n\nThe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality. The hotel WiFi averages 10 Mbps down/5 Mbps up and is complimentary.\n\nNot recommended and officially denied going forward.

I can only comment on carry out. \n\nI have ordered carry out food from here a number of times and am always impressed. I typically get a shrimp or chicken dish, and soup. It is definitely above average Chinese food. I guess that's why its more expensive than most Chinese places.

My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.\nWe ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.

We loved our Thai place in Boston and really missed having someplace to go get Pad Thai. We moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean. The staff are all really nice and attentive. They have takeout, which works for us since we live a few blocks away.\n\nI thought the food was great. We've tried a few different meals. My wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine. I do like my food spicy and if I had one complaint it's that I wouldn't mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what I've experienced so far. The food has great flavors and think it is spot on.

We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was average in taste, much smaller portions and higher prices than before, and the service was not good at all.  We waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check.  My wife had to remind the waiter that she hadn't gotten her sushi order.  We had a coupon and they added 18% for a gratuity, per the coupon, which we didn't see beforehand -- the coupon is a scam so watch out.  We wouldn't have tipped that much based on the above comments.  Our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened.  Yes, we have been eating here for 15 plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently.  No one ever came to our table to ask how things were going -- a sign of poor customer relations.

This week, I took my son to see the \""Chipmunks Squeakquel\"" (or whatever it's called). We've been here several times before, since it is in the University City area near where we live. \n\nThere is plenty of parking. Lines for tickets are usually long, and uncomfortable in the cold, blowing wind of December, or the humid summer heat, for that matter. (Why can't they put the ticket counters on the INSIDES of theaters? This is one tradition that should be broken soon!)  Matinee tickets for the two of us were $13.50. \n\nThe theater itself is in good shape. Movies are usually in focus, and the sound is usually okay, with some distortion, but not great. (Frankly, DVDs sound better in my living room.)\n\nBUT: Concessions are a complete rip-off. I usually know this, but Jay talked me into it. We got a medium (huge!) popcorn, two \""small\"" bladder-busting drinks, and a box of Twizzlers. Twenty friggin' bucks! I'm sure the DVD wouldn't cost $33.50 to buy, and we could watch it over and over. (I doubt we'll be buying it... the movie is grade B entertainment. Funny once, but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun.)\n\nThe restroom had no paper towels, and the trash cans were overflowing. A smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks. \n\nFor a family, I think money spent on a large LCD TV and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment. Rent movies from Red Box or Netflix, or hook up an Apple TV or something similar, and you have a better \""movie-NOT-going\"" experience. \n\nI can make much better (and less expensive!) popcorn, and the adults and I can have a beer. AND, I can pause the movie for those all-important, \""Let's all go to the lobby\"" breaks.\n\nEvery time I go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen, I'm more and more disappointed by the experience. I guess a lot of others feel the same way, since the theater we were in was nearly empty.\n\nIt's a pity; you would think they would set the prices low enough to ensure all the seats are filled at most screenings. If they used some basic Economics 101 theory in their marketing model, and made a little on each of a lot of people, the total revenue would be maximized, and everyone would win. But as it is, they're losing more and more of us to the home theater market for 90+% of our movie-viewing dollars.

Great Way to Spend the 4th.\n\nBeen awhile since I've been to Outback and they have revamped the menu a bit.  Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.\n\nMy wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.\n\nOnly negative was the bread they served. It was a very dark bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.\n\nMy Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.\n\nService was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.\n\nAtmosphere --- What can I say?  Typical Outback.\n\nIf you're in the Carolina Place Mall Area, this is a nice spot for Dinner and now Lunch

I was hoping the previous reviewer had merely had a bad stay and/or the property had updated since then, but no such luck.\n\nThe beds here are ROCKS!  It felt like I was sleeping on a box spring instead of a mattress and a really had and painful one at that.  When we \""got up\"" in the morning (that phrase in quotations as it implies we had a good night's sleep, which we didn't) my husband pointed out that the side of the mattress was slumping, so it was probably very old.  Definitely not Marriott standard.\n\nWireless internet was slow, but a CAT5 was provided in the room for laptops that got internet up to speed just fine.\n\nBreakfast when I had it was good.

My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, \""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding\"".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation. My level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than saying.....This was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant. No words......

Had the opportunity to visit Smokey Bones this week. I had the rib & chicken (White Meat- they were out of dark meat) combo. It was [[actually]] pretty good. [[However]] the worst part of this dining experience was the host who was suppose to great us when we came through the door. He started off by saying \""just 2\"". As though 2 people was not enough. Well, I can appreciate some good hospitality and a welcoming personality before patronizing a restaurant that I don't frequent very often.

Usually asking the server what is her favorite dish gets you a pretty good recommendation, but in this case, it was crap!  The smoked brisket had that discoloration that happens to meat when it's been sitting out for a while.  And it wasn't even tender!!  Am I asking for too much?

Everything about this place screams a budget hotel, except for the price.   This is a motel quality establishment charging upscale hotel quality prices.  \n\nGranted, the staff is nice.  And, if you need a place that allows pets, I guess this could be a good choice.   Otherwise, don't be fooled.   I have staid at other homewood suites in the past, and this one is certainly not up to par.

This was a bad experience from the start. The hostes told me that there was a one hour wait (even though the dining room was half empty). Twenty minutes into my wait, two parties came in and were seated while I waited. After complining I was seated.\n\nOrdered a salad and ribs. The salad was good, the ribs were as tough as leather. The baked potato had to be broken with fork and knife since it probably had been baking for hours.\n\nThe only good thing about the experience was the server which was very attentive and appologized profusely for the innedible food.

We went on a Friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table. The waitress was good and always on point with service. \n\nAs for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat. \n\nTo top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there. \n\nEating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there. Nor do I really plan on going anytime soon

I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""bones\"" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""lunch\"" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""fire roasted corn\"" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so.

I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.\n\n*I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.\n\n*The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.  \n\n*They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.

My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't [[so]] [[great]] either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out. I don't imagine being back. People who worked there were nice though.

Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nI went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable). Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third. Ever. \n\nI know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've had more authentic Chinese food at Panda Express. What should have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu...and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban). I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months.

I will not return, terrible customer service. I ordered a pizza from here because I had received a \""welcome\"" packet with some coupons including one for Demarco's giving a free large 1 topping pizza, dine in or take out. I called and ordered then went to pick it up, upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasn't accepting these coupons and it's only good with a $40 or something purchase (the coupon was newly received so this wasn't news to the owner he just didn't pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me). I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't give stipulations anywhere and that's false advertising (not even sure if that's legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself). She understood but it was the owners call. I ended up purchasing the pizza (needed to eat!) and the pizza wasn't good. It had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt. Because I'm pregnant I opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views I left vowing that I wont return. Which is unfortunate because it's very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service!

I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.  I called to talk with the Manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  Which I guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers.

This is a nice looking but poorly designed hotel. Despite having over 300 rooms, they only have 2 elevators. I was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair. Lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage 1 flight of stairs with 2 good feet. Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.\n\nThe food is also terrible and overpriced. Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food! \n\nThe temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well. Our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that I nearly fainted on at least 2 occasions. The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their down-filled duvets and fluffy pillows.

I love the Capital Brewery because I think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. And if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the Bier Stube, Capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. I highly recommend the Capital Brewery. And don't forget to take the short tour!

The Sports Pub is the kind of place I tend to find myself at when I get overruled by my friends on the east side.  I don't know the east side of town all that well but I [[do]] know that I like the Ale Asylum A [[LOT]].  [[I]] seem to [[be]] successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because [[really]] this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are [[so]] many [[places]] with [[better]] beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and [[better]] food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a [[bad]] impression of the [[place]].  \n\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little [[bits]] of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.

Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.

I could visit this place four times and [[give]] it four different reviews. Today there was a long wait at the cutting table, which was (at first) staffed by three different people. The little number-giving-out machine was empty, so we all just stood in an orderly line. One of the women at the cutting table left right after I got there (there were five of us in line then) saying that she was already late for her break. I didn't like to see her go, but I understood about the break thing (sometimes you *really* need your break, and sometimes your manager *really* wants you to take your break at the scheduled time). \n\nIt took a long time to get my stuff [[cut]] because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric. If I was that [[customer]] I'd have been thrilled at that level of service. \n\nSo I [[finally]] [[got]] my stuff [[cut]]. The woman cutting it was very efficient (but I think a little rattled from being so busy) and admired my choice of fabric (hey, I love to be validated). \n\nI went up front and stood in line some more.

The woman who checked me out was mellow and chatty and also admired my fabric (I'm starting to think it's not my great taste but some new policy). \n\nSo not a great visit but not the worst, either.

A new friend suggested I check out Rebecca Lynn Studio; he is balding, and said \""if they can make me look good, imagine what they can do for you!\""  So I popped in one day for a cut--literally called em up and drove right on over, no wait!  \n\nThe place is clean and cute, and they have wet stations which means you don't have to traipse back and forth across the salon for a wash, they just spin you around and viola!  \n\nDan cut my hair, and he was friendly and personable.  He really asked me how I liked my hair cut, what tools to use, etc., since I know \""my hair best.\""  My hair can be a little difficult to work with, so I really appreciate that he took the time to ask.\n\nAnother great bonus: 1 week guarantee on the cut.  If I didn't like it, I could come back for a redo or even get my money back.  Got the cut on Monday and was back on Friday for some tweaking, which I'm glad I did, but even better to know the offer was there.  \n\n$23 for a haircut is a wonderful deal, but beware: CASH ONLY!  They also do styling, hair color, perms, nails, waxing and make up.  They are an Aveda salon (but not a concept salon).\n\nI haven't decided yet to keep seeing Dan, or back to Robyn at Cha Cha, but I would recommend Rebecca Lynn Studio to anyone looking for a great deal on great service.  As of 4/13 they were going to be closed for 10 days to remodel, so be sure and call ahead.

The Bridges has [[become]] my default golf course for meeting up with friends and getting in 18.  It is a city-owned course on the northeast [[side]] of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an fairly easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course, but I [[played]] last weekend and much of the course is back in playable [[condition]].  I [[especially]] like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the [[kind]] of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to [[keep]] you [[coming]] back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the [[area]]. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is [[right]] on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite.

I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends.

Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump. Go fig'. Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created. However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund.

Still have yet to try the famous zucchini pancakes, but next time, I must.  I must also remember to save room for dessert!  Look forward to returning sooner than later to try some of the other new lunch options on the menu.  Only downer is the wait/lack of parking on a busy day.  Overall, two thumbs up from me, Monty.

If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I've been coming here since opened and it is consistently the best. Breakfast all day, more than just burgers and fries, deserts, beer selection....I can't rave enough.\n\nThe meatloaf of the Gods is to die for and their Just Coffee roast (their own blend) is so amazingly good I have my mom buy it and send it up to me in Minneapolis. It's that good.\n\nSome of the people that work there have been there since I was a kid. Its a neighborhood place where you're bound to run into people you know and I make a point to go there at least twice while I'm home to visit.\n\nYay Monty's!

If you have poached eggs on your menu and do not know how to poach an egg do NOT offer it as an option. I got the breakfast item with spinach, mornay sauce ,and poached eggs, only to receive hard boiled eggs. It completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back. Not to mention that the food is always mediocre. Not happy and not coming back.

Fabulous food and AWESOME atmosphere. Perfect place to take your kids or have a little date. ;) The only thing that is upsetting is that once you fall in love with something on the menu, it always gets taken off.

A few of us hit Smoky Jon's for lunch today.  It was insisted that it's the best BBQ in Madison, so I was game to try it.\n\nThe place has character - you order at a window and go take a seat.  They bring the food out to you.  Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.\n\nI got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... \""warm\"", I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \""yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\"".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \""you know, that was REALLY good!\""\n\nWhile it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!\n\nMy coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!\n\nTip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)

Having returned from a BBQ binge in Kansas City a few months ago, we decided we'd get ribs in celebration of the Royals making the playoffs. Then winning the pennant. And then again for Game 7 of the World Series. So we've had Smoky Jon's ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks.\n\nHere's what's excellent: The pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic. Right up there with the best there is. Just yummy.\n\nHere's what's not: Extremely inconsistent ribs. (I completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane... it really ought to be removed, every time.Not doing so is laziness by the pitmaster.)\n\nFor us, Batch #1 was pretty good -- not KC level, but totally fine. Batch #2 really was KC level... just excellent--tender, juicy ribs, clean bones, very nice. Food heaven. Batch #3 was terrible -- dry meat, thick membrane, difficult to even cut into 3-rib chunks. There's no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone.\n\nSo after spending about $165 here in the last three weeks, I can't recommend it. Hey, ribs ain't cheap (and that's fine), but it's hard to justify if the quality isn't even close. I realize there will always be slight variations...that's what makes BBQ great. But the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me.

My previous review was for an oil change, which I still stand by.  This time I brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise.  I was told that the bracket holding my flex tube was broken and it would be around $350 to replace the whole pipe.  The pipe itself was not damaged and I asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car (either by welding it or creating a new bracket). The mechanic gave me a rude answer about coat hangers.  \n\nI called around and was quoted $200 to replace the pipe at Speedys Muffler. When I brought it in there to get it replaced, they told me the pipe itself could just be bracketed to the car for $45. \n\nMake sure you call around before getting work done here in case there are other repair options that Chet's didn't consider.

We recently bought a mid-century house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms. We went to the Rubin's Clearance Center and happened to catch their moving sale, which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price. Nice! You won't pay Ikea prices, but this is, for the most part, high-quality [[stuff]]. Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelf/storage unit/drawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too. \n\nThe downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was \""20 minutes until closing time.\"" This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the \""oh, you have a half hour before we close\"" trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K, but still), you shouldn't be pushing people out the door. I might have picked up a couple of other items if I hadn't felt rushed out.

Barely OK. Service was flat out terrible. It's always bad when your server throws another server under the bus for taking 5 minutes to get service after sitting down...not impressed. Service throughout the meal was extremely slow and it took 30 minutes to just get our food (for 2 people). \n\nThe food is OK. Not even close to the best in Madison. The ribs were very dry and tough. The flavor of the rub was good however. The BBQ sauce on the table was also very good. \n\nWill not be going back.

For all the hype, Michael's is quite a disappointment. \n\nMaybe it's because I didn't try the custard. But seriously, I didn't need more weighing down in this weather...so I ordered an orange crush float instead. For something that would have cost me MAYBE 50cents to make at home, I paid close to $5 for a 12oz cup. That is ridiculous. In general, I think their prices are pretty steep for what you get....you'd probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck...\n\nLike RB, I also had an issue with the service. It was slow, disorganized, and not very friendly. The line was almost out the door, but the employees behind the counter didn't even ATTEMPT to speed up the service. One of them just disappeared into a back room. tsktsk. I also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed, and then had to UNcrumple the paper so she could re-read the order to her coworker. Really? \n\nAnyway, I will probably give the Monroe St. Michael's - and their custards/burgers - a shot, but I'm not going to get my hopes up.

The worst Arby's I have ever eaten at. If you want a good one, visit the one on Park. \nSo, here is why it is bad.\n1) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered. Four different sandwiches. This is compared to other Arby's I've eaten at.\n2) they say they don't have any monthly deals. I was told they belong to the same owner as the one on Park and they have monthly deals.\n3) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order. We paid but did not get things.\n4) their customer service is awful\nI don't expect much in life but when I go somewhere to give them my money , I expect better than what I got here.

I have been to The Ultimate several times for massages with Ellen and would highly recommend her.  She is very personable, friendly and professional.  I feel extremely relaxed after our sessions.  I also used Ellen for a prenatal massage when pregnant. Being as big and uncomfortable as I was, I was worried if I would be able to relax fully.  Ellen has blankets and pillows just for that reason! Super comfortable and she remembers to ask about the baby after she was born. Highly recommend!\n\nThe only reason I did not give 5 stars was that the hallway outside the room can get a bit loud if people are walking down, talking or laughing. They should maybe make that more of a quiet space with notices that people are in session.  Nothing Ellen could help though!

Horrible service, inedible food, tremendous swivel factor. But, my drink was fine.\n\nTheir advertised drink specials are good, but most concentrated on shots and low-end liquors (think Smirnoff for $3). The \""service\"" at the bar was hard to come by, although there were at least two bartenders working.  I asked for a minute with the menu, and spent the next 20 minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order.\n\nOrdered the shrimp special which was not very special at all.  Although there were 6 grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good, the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless, watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli, steamed but otherwise unadorned.  At $12.99 it was definitely not a good value.  Plus, it took for-ev-er to arrive. The gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special, and his cafeteria-style serving arrived in about 30 seconds.  That didn't make me very happy for him, however, as it looked equally disgusting.\n\nI cannot recommed this place for anything other than a drink, although the pool players seemed to be having a good time.

I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?

I have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review.\nGeneral Tso's is my go to dish for Chinese take out, an this place failed miserably on that! Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck.\nThe lo mien was also horrible. There was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around. \nIf I wanted to order leftover's I would order leftover's!\n\nThere saving grace is their hot sour soup. Very tasty. But...... I had one bad experience with it where I ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container, they put the left over/bottom of the pot in and filled it up only 3/4 of the way. Talk about shady service! I even watched them do it from behind the counter. Trying to pull a fast one on me. I think NOT!\n\nI'm still giving it a solid 2 stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too (other than the tasty soup, that is when they have it available). But in all honestly, nothing special. I can go to any Chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week. \n\nSo yeah.....If you want good Chinese. this is not the place I recommend. If you want quick Chinese just because your craving it....well maybe rethink it or just settle for the China Inn.

For the all hype this places gets, it sure didn't live up to it. Sure, it was busy- what place isn't on a Friday night in Wisconsin. Rail drinks were prices right- two drinks for $6.00. I ordered the lake perch- what a DISAPPOINTMENT. If you've been to Door County/eastern WI and had perch there, don't bother with Tobys perch. It was not good. My cottage cheese was warm, and my date's \""salad\"" was lettuce with salad dressing plopped on it. No veggies, croutons- nothing. The server was nice enough, for bring so overwhelmed and busy.

I love Culver's as a company, first.  They are solid through and through.  \n\nEach location varies a little, but I think, on the whole, the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well.  I've never been disappointed with any Culver's at which I've eaten.\n\nThis location does everything well.  I work near here, so I go here at least once a week for lunch, and have for probably the last four years.  I have never had a single complaint.  Even when they're busy, they manage to keep the place looking well and getting the food out fast and hot.\n\nThe only knock I could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isn't great.  It could get fixed.  If you park on the right-hand side of the lot, you can get stuck in your space if there's a long line at the drive-thru.

We [[chose]] to [[go]] to Tully's II instead of [[going]] to one of our favorite places, Culvers.\nBig mistake.... Around 7:30 on a Friday night we [[walk]] in to the sign that [[says]] \""Please Seat Yourself\"".  [[So]] we [[walk]] through the Pool Table [[area]] to [[get]] to the back dining area, since it was close to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no [[help]] from the waitress [[filling]] the salad bar [[right]] next to us, we all sit down at a table.  [[A]] few [[moments]] after [[sitting]] down a waitress ([[Older]] Woman) [[came]] to our table. She [[took]] our [[drink]] [[order]]: [[two]] [[waters]] with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and [[disappeared]].  She reappeared with our [[drinks]] a few [[minutes]] later.  The waitress [[takes]] our [[orders]], Two Cod [[Fish]] Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were [[informed]] that the salad bar was [[included]] with our meal.  Well... From the time we [[walked]] into Tully's II to the time we [[left]] they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a [[large]] spread.  After 10 [[minutes]] of watching this woman [[stock]] the salad [[bar]] at a snails pace and a [[distasteful]] [[look]] on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \""All You Can Eat\"" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \"" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\"", not \""is there anything I can do to make it right?\"" or \""come back and have a meal on us\""..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.  Monona's best Fish Fry...my Foot.  Monona has poor standards if this is the best in town.

The waitress [[aim]] our [[regularise]], Two Cod [[angle]] Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were [[inform]] that the salad bar was [[include]] with our meal.  Well... From the time we [[walk]] into Tully's II to the time we [[depart]] they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a [[heavy]] spread.  After 10 [[moment]] of watching this woman [[store]] the salad [[ginmill]] at a snails pace and a [[unsavory]] [[feel]] on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \""All You Can Eat\"" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \"" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\"", not \""is there anything I can do to make it right?\"" or \""come back and have a meal on us\""..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.  Monona's best Fish Fry...my Foot.  Monona has poor standards if this is the best in town.

But we must have come in at the perfect time because there was one empty, clean table- and it was ours!\nOur server was very nice, our food came out quickly and tasted great.

Now that's what I call mediocre!\n\nI'm not a snob when it comes to Chinese food at all. I've experienced both unnecessarily authentic Chinese cuisine and hyper-Americanized Chinese food and I will go for something in-between every time.\n\nSo this place seems like it will fit right in with that, but it doesn't. The service blows, they have a $7 minimum charge for credit/debit cards - when I told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare, I walked out.\n\nThe couple of times I have eaten here I was not even mildly enthused about anything - the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor, or any particular flavor at all, it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups. The meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small- not worth the price.\n\nDon't worry, there's about 15,000 Asian restaurants on Green St - I'm sure that you'll find something...

I adopted a dog a few months ago. She is a 3 year old border collie lab [[mix]] [[named]] Lily. I know when the dogs are given up the humane society relies on the former family being honest about the dogs behavior. I was [[told]] she was a friendly, sweet lap dog that has never had issues with other [[animals]]. She [[gets]] along with my cat great, but when other dogs come along on walks she flips out. She even attacked one recently. I'm positive she was abused by her previous family. Cchs didn't [[take]] great care of her either. Her pads were all torn in her front paws, which had her limping for the first few weeks, her gums [[bled]] like crazy and her teeth were in awful condition, and she was too skinny. We were ready to [[give]] her back because of the strain it put us through. We have since [[turned]] her around with training and gotten her back to full health, but it took hundreds and hundreds of [[dollars]].

When I went in it smelled overpoweringly like barf. Remembrance of the stomach bile stink still haunts me whenever I think of or pass by this eyesore. It was so strong I couldn't talk, listen or even think. I could hardly choke down the swill and nod to whatever crap music was playing or in rough acknowledgment of what I thought someone else was saying. WHAT DID SHE SAY? THIS PLAY DUCKLING BUCKS? Its pretty loud. \n\nNeedless to say it was also too crowded, dark and dirty. I realize that I am not exactly in their target market, being over 21 and all, but this place is just horrifically bad. Those that characterize this bar as anything but an unmitigated crap-dungeon are either lying to themselves or have never been to a decent bar.

Common Ground gets a lot of flack for being expensive, but really it's only expensive if you're comparing Common Ground's organic items to the conventional items at Schnuck's or Meijer - and several time I've noticed Common Ground's organics were actually priced cheaper than those at the chain stores. You also have to consider the fact that Common Ground is a small, independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive - and it tries its best to 'practice what it preaches' in it's business practices, from biodegradable, american-made produce bags to decent employee wages. All those [[little]] ethical steps cost money - and since the co-op is community owned, ultimately the money you spend there is going back into the community, rather than in some corrupt CEO's pocket, and that's [[always]] a good thing.\n\nApart from my price-justification rant, this is the most [[awesome]] grocery store in town.

I ordered a blue plate special, country fried steak, [[mashed]] potatoes and [[gravy]], and peas. The country fried steak patty was chopped formed, deep fried, and covered with a gravy dry mix, which also covered the potatoes. The peas were from a can. Haven't eaten there since.

This is a small, shabby-chic French restaurant serving simple french food.

We [[went]] in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After [[sitting]] there for ten minutes we were [[led]] to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of [[customers]].

So my wife [[ordered]] the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I [[ordered]] some [[sort]] of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous [[moment]] was when the server [[asked]] me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, [[look]] it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, [[had]] some portabella [[mushrooms]] with it and some fresh parsley (to [[make]] it [[appear]] [[fresh]]) though my entre looked like it [[has]] been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!

I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \""Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\"" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell.

Better than most chain pizza, it's ok.  \n\nWe got a thin crust, which was nice and crispy, only a little greasy, ok ingredients, not amazing on the cheese, and had kind of a bland crust.\n\nI guess that doesn't sound too good, but I really promise it's better than any national chain pizza you'll find in town.  It also has a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere.

Love this place! Who would've thought I'd be reviewing a library?\n\nThe building is so cool and modern inside. So many places to lounge, a cafe, an outdoor area to chill, and the best thing of all for me is that there is a huge play area in the children's section! With toys, puzzles, and books galore. I haven't had to buy too many books for my little one (she's 1 now!). Instead, I check out 6 to 8 books per every 4 weeks for her to enjoy and they are all usually in good shape. Plus they have a free baby time class there where we can bring our babies. The instructors are so talented. They sing and read books to our babies. They also bring toys for them to play with. My little girl loves it! And loves to be with the other babies as well. Awesome!

I went here for their new customer cleaning discount. I made the appointment last week. I showed up 15 minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested. The front doors were locked, no one visible in the office, no response to knocking, no closed sign or \""Back at [clock]...\"". After pounding on the door in the rain for several minutes before calling the office's phone. A person who claimed to work for a 'sister practice' answered, confirmed my appointment, and put me on hold while he tried to get ahold of someone in the office. After several minutes in the rain, he told me that he could only reach an answering machine. I left.\n\nI have never been so grossly disrespected by what's purported to be a business.

This place is the worst. \nOf course, it's beautiful and has a great selection of books...so long as you don't mind living under the most tyrannical librarian regime ever to live. \nEvery time I walk into this library, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells wondering what rule I might break next. And God forbid they catch your child with a Goldfish cracker in the kids section...off with their heads! \nAdditionally, once it was off limits to Savoy/Mahomet residents, I felt unwelcome there and totally uncomfortable. \nI do have a grad student friend who had her feet slightly outside her sandals and got yelled at for it. Who the hell are these librarians to tell people how they need to sit or wear their shoes? \nAnd the children's librarians are not friendly or nice with the kids, but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there.

I am a medical professional, I asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live.  I took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment.  Isn't that what I asked!  After 5 days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal.  I can't say enough about my vet, she is awesome and thorough.

Today is St. Joseph's Day, a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian-American households is as special as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish, and a day rich in food rituals.  To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's \""Italian\"" restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the \""sacra tavola\"" or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh \""off the boats\"" and [[barely]] spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who had menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of \""La Famiglia\"" but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local \""Eye-talian\"" businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The d\u00e9cor bordered on tacky, with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  Really?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I ordered a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \""fare la scarpetta\"", which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the \""Eye-talian\"" food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to.

My fiancee and I have been putting off going back to see the University of Illinois campus for a while now. We saw that Super 8 was having a crazy anniversary sale on rooms where if you booked online on a certain date and time, your room would only be $8.88. We decided this would be the perfect oppurtunity to head down to Champaign so we tried to book the room and got it.\n\nThis is the point where I tell you if I had paid any more than $8.88, I would have felt ripped off. The room smelled very weird (that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell), the bedding was very itchy, and the shower curtain didn't even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub. The only positives (the reason it gets two stars instead of one) were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad. Honestly though, unless it is a crazy deal like we had, there are better hotels in the area. There is even a nicer Super 8 near Lincoln Avenue.

The food was okay but some of the staff are very rude and uncourteous. I had a very unpleasant encounter during lunch time once when the person serving the food demanded a better tip from me when I was leaving the restaurant!!! I had actually tipped him fairly well and I think it is very unprofessional to vocally demand for more money even otherwise! He did not seem to care that I was a regular at the restaurant before this incident and I have decided never to visit the place again.

The Good:\n-I liked the decor.  It was very pretty.\n-The \""Soup of the Day\"" was Red Pepper-Goat Cheese.

Some restaurants in this area have Chicago-envy.  That must be the problem with Radio Maria.  The fusion menu doesn't work because the chef has not mastered the basic cuisines that they are trying to blend.  Dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad.  \n\nThe staff used to describe it as a Caribbean-Polish Fusion.  (Really.)  I have no idea what's going on now.  Spanish-Korean?  Soul Food Middle Eastern Style?  Masa boats. Frog legs. Ground coffee rubs. Pad Thai. Torta.   The motto seems to be:  when in doubt, add more things that don't go together, none of it done well.\n\nThis could only be mistaken for sophistication by people who have never been anywhere sophisticated.

Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, d\u00e9cor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff. But thankfully this was not the case! We made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table. I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area.

Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.\n\nI'm not sure if Palazzo is always open \""sometimes\"" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. \n\nEvery time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. \n\nAlso? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks.

I can't seem to [[understand]] 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.\n\nYes, Majerle's is worse.  \n\nOkay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the [[place]] [[makes]] me [[feel]] like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.\[[n]]\nThe set up is [[terrible]].

Wow. I have been going to this practice for 3-4 years. I have had some troubles with them in the past but this is the kicker of them all. I just called and explained to the person at the front desk that I have been having some breast pain and didn't know if I should come in earlier than my Oct. 1st  Well Woman exam. Her response was, \""Well, if you come in early you will have to pay for an office visit.\"" I said, \""well if I wait I'll just talk to her about it at my Well Woman.\"" Her reply, \""if you talk to her about it then, then you will be charged extra.\"" My reply, \""just for talking about it??\"" Her reply, \""yup, I don't know what to tell you. Just go to your primary care physician.\"" I then explained to her that this was a gynecological issue... No response. Her overall tone was brash, rude, and short. Did I mention uncaring.\n\nUnbelievable. Never, ever have I been so appalled. A woman calls and says she has breast pain and isn't sure if she should come in and this is how the front desk responds!! I'm outraged and waiting for someone to call me back from the office. I think Dr. Johnstone has the right to know how the front desk is treating her patients.

Another dismal review for this company. I called for a 6 AM pickup to the airport like I had several times previously. Dispatch informed someone would arrive. I waited until 6:10 AM and called again-dispatch then told me another 15 minutes until pickup! I stated that was not acceptable as I had a flight to catch. I ended up driving myself to the airport. Oh yeah, the driver called, as boarding for my plane started.

HUGE disappointment!!!! Stopped for a quick dinner before a show. Ordered 2 burgers medium. They came out extremely well done & the buns were hard & dry. The waitress took them back to the kitchen & returned with 2 more well done burgers! What the heck?! When we told her (& showed her), she apologized & took 20% off the bill. We didn't have time for round 3. They didn't even send a manager over. $30 for an inedible meal. We will not be back. I'd recommend trying somewhere else.

I barely noticed it, and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it. Also, the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet, but it was never an unbearable cold or heat. Once we got settled in we went to the pool, its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it, so that was a bummer. \n\nFor lunch, we went next door to McCaffery's.

Its a cute little hotel and for staying on a Saturday night, there were no dramatic noises going on and I didn't hear anyone talking in another room, having sex, or going to the bathroom.

yum! this place is yummy! it is my favorite authentic mexican restaurant to take out-of-towners to. the doorman/security guard is so sweet and makes sure you don't get shot and that your car is there after your meal. the surrounding area is a bit tough, and i don't suggest wandering far from the parking lot if you know what i mean. the somewhat scary location makes everything a bit more authentic in my eyes.\n\ni made the mistake of ordering chicken once, and i was disappointed. not sure why ... maybe it is because they don't use all white meat chicken. or maybe it was an off day. or maybe i just don't like their chicken. i don't know. but now i stick with beef or cheese based items and everything i get is super delish. love the beans! they do 'em right. margaritas are freshly made and full of alcohol, not like the watered down versions you get from a stupid machine at other places. gotta love the free chips and salsa ... the salsa always tastes fresh, and they'll give you a super-spicy version if you ask. and they keep 'em coming, even after dinner if you want more.  try the carne asada cheese crisp as an appetizer ... it is huge, but so good that if you have more than 4 people at your table you should order two. if you don't someone's going to wish they had gotten more.

[[Nothing]] was fresh, everything tasted like old fryer grease or freezerburn (except my drink). To their credit, the service was immaculate. The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am really amazed by the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, this place is just a couple blocks from my house so I have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when I walk to the lightrail on my way to work.

Awful.  Gross.  Disappointing.\n\nA co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.\n\nI got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.\n\nI won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road.

I have been here multiple times for all facets of dinning including lunch, dinner, drinks, late night bites and a corporate function and everytime i've liked it. It is one of my favorite places to go before a baseball or basketball game. They have a great selection of handcrafed beers both on tap and in bottles. There food is also really good for what i take as more of a bar enviornment. There burgers, sandwiches and pastas are all well executed and have a gourmet flair with resonable prices. The lobster bisque is fantastic, and so are the salads and appetizers. They have a great patio downstairs and a balcony where you can eat and drink outside upstairs too. Check this place out it is more than worth the visit, and they have good happy hour and reverse happy hour specials.

I've [[hesitated]] to write about Fate. I [[always]] enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.\n\nWe've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. \n\nI'm not really high on the \""this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time\"" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable [[fiasco]]. \n\nI don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The [[place]] is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited [[fifty-five]] minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into [[skeletons]].\n\nThe server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.\n\nAnyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- \""the food here is terrible... and such small portions!\""\n\nI'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. \n\nAnyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it.

I really wanted to like this place. I live nearby and I love the Downtown area. I want all the places here to be 4-5 star joints. But my partner and I showed up on a Sunday afternoon, with only a half-dozen people in the place and just as many waitresses, and they still took 45 minutes to deliver our food. We watched our waitress eat her lunch at the bar. And then when our food came it wasn't right.\n\nWe ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey. One bite, however, and we knew our bread was more than day-old. I actually had to ask them if it was toasted (it wasn't) because it was just as hard and dry as a piece of toasted bread. Back it went.\n\nThe pizza which I ordered because of the Kalamata Olives (their \""Mediteranean\"") was missing Kalamata Olives. That's right -- it's the major ingredient on the pie and the joker in the kitchen forgot to put them on. \n\nNever mind, after 45 minutes you'll eat anything. Beer was overpriced at $5 for a glass. We got out of there as quickly as we could after the food was consumed. Won't be back.

Dined with a good friend of mine while in town, so the slow(ish) service was no bother. Actually, we had good service. They were on top of my need for water with lots of ice.\n\nLisa had the chile rellanos and she said they were good. The portion was large and she took about half home.\n\nI got the chimichanga. It was a delight. The meat was done perfectly and was very flavorful and not at all bland. Usually my rice goes uneaten, but this rice was about the [[best]] Mexican rice I've ever had. The beans were as I like them; full of cheese. \n\nThey have 2 sauces that come with the chips, one a chipotle, which I'm not a fan of, the other a spicy red which I slathered on top of my food.\n\nI'm sort of shocked at the low stars this place has gotten. My experience was [[grand]] and that's no bull! (Matador; bull; get it?)

Heading to catch a flick at The Arizona Center. Decided to checked out Mi Amigo's. To start with, it took about 5 minutes before anyone bother to talk to us. Once we did get to order, we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas. The tortilla soup was really bad. It tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt. We ended up sending it back. The chicken fajitas were actually ok, but not great. \n\nThe real downer was the service. Waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place. Limited interested in actually taking our order, bringing out food, etc..\n\nOverall, there are much better choices. You should look elsewhere if you are hungry for Mexican food.

The volume of the music and announcements were so loud, we couldn't even talk to half the people at out table! They took our drink order and we didn't see it until half an hour later. The food was HORRIBLE! How can you ruin a spaghetti dinner??First of all, it was cold! Cold spaghetti !! Hardly any sauce! The house salad was taken out of a plastic bag and dumped into a bowl....at an Italian place, they served the salad with only ranch dressing ..... Not even Italian! And no choices offered.

This has been my car wash since I lived in midtown off 3rd street and Thomas. They do a great job, and are very accommodating if they miss a spot. They tend to be somewhat expensive, but then again they are not scratching your car with machines. I used to get the side wash with my Audi because of some modifactions that kept it from being on the rails, and for $15 you couldn't get a better wash in town. \n\nI don't recommend their detail service, as they are not very complete, but for car washes A+

I wish this place were better! The only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour. I went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average. Don't get me wrong, the hostesses were nice... when they were actually around.\n\nI had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce. Generally I find that if the veggie burger is good, the normal is bad and vise versa. However, both were terrible. My veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful. My friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless. \n\nFor the price I would expect better food... much better food. \n\nHonestly, they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps. Quit the food, up the drinks.

I [[had]] really high hopes, and I was thrilled that it's so close to my house... [[However]] I soon started second guessing myself after pulling up. I was there before anyone else and watched the attendant avoid my car and instead go to the 2 old guys in expensive sport cars that showed up 2 or so minutes after me, and she even waited a little longer after that like she was hoping another car would pull up. When one didn't, she finally came to my car (and her attitude sucked on top of it). It's not like I own a nasty beat up car either, it's a newer Mitsubishi.

This place is way overrated!!! They let ur car sit for 5-10 minutes before they even start to dry it.  By this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time.  Their armor all has gone down as well.  They used to have the best tire gloss that would last for 10 days, now they use a cheaper brand that's dull.  This place has really gone down over the years.

Hard Rock Cafe is a cool place to go if you're in the area and want to kill time before a concert or a game, but destination bar it's not. The food is average and the drinks aren't anything out of the ordinary. Infact, there's nothing really unique about the Hard Rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because you're dining and/or drinking at the HARD ROCK CAFE. \n\nI'm disappointed that it doesn't compare to others around the world and seems out of place in Phoenix.

I went here a couple weeks ago and was pleased with my cheese steak. I had it then with just the meat and cheese. Today when I returned, the guy at the counter asks, \""With onions and mushrooms?\"" Okay, yeah. \""Sweet or spicy peppers?\"" Spicy, please. And what I received knocked the socks off that earlier sandwich. \n\nThis place is tiny, cramped, a bit chaotic and is apparently cooled by wall-mounted fans.

Went there with my girlfriend for what I thought would be good bbq. She ordered the half chicken and I got a pulled pork sandwich.  Not only did her chicken come out pink and bleeding once but it happened twice. When I told them the first time the cashier said, \""we usually have good food.\"" So it's okay to serve bad food too? He asked how the chicken was when he was bringing in the chairs from outside and we said the same,  still pink and bleeding. All he said was oh okay and walked away. I didn't even eat my sandwich because if they couldn't cook chicken right why should I trust them to cook the pork correctly? When I went to the front to talk with them they all disappeared.  Never would I think about going back and spend my money there again.

Decided to take a short trip downtown to try the Central Coast Wine Tasting event held here last week.  We had a blast!  While the rep that hosted the wine tasting made the wine tasting a fun and informative event, we really enjoyed the atmosphere and FOOD! \n\nThe tapas plate that came with the [[wine]] tasting was fabulous, blue cheese and bacon stuffed dates, a super tasty California cheese ([[bought]] some to take home) and a tiny, but very yummy shrimp salad. That only made us want to try more!  \n\nJeannie loves scallops, so [[naturally]] she ordered the Scallop Martini.

First time here.  I'll give credit where it's due, they have apparently been reading the reviews because the staff made an extra effort to be friendly and courteous. \n\nI had 2 bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork.  While eating my sandwiches I had the thought there should be laws enacted to constitute what restaurants can call bbq.  Boiled meat covered in BBQ sauce is NOT BBQ.  \nI grew up in the South, I've been to Memphis in May a couple of times, so my standards for BBQ are admittedly higher than average, but this was not even close to real BBQ.\n\nWas it decent food.  Sure.  Decent, at best.  Was it the reason I got an upset stomach a couple hours later, possibly.   I don't care about the old decor, dirty looking bathrooms or anything else, if the food was good I would go back.  It wasn't.

Watched a Suns game here recently and had a blast.  The arena is in the heart of Downtown Phoenix and is near bars and restaurants.  It's really easy to have a pre and post-game party.

Harsh to say, but I hate arenas. The only time I go is to see s concert, show or special event as I'm not an arena-type sports fan. Last night's event was Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson-The Immortal Tour. I have to say as far as arenas go, the US Airways Center is pretty amazing.  Entering and exiting are easy-peasy. It didn't feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multi-story connected building.  \n\nThere's a Starbucks on site, which was like heaven to me . . . I wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show, There are other well-known food concessions throughout the arena, as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat.\n\nSince we were sitting in Section 102, first row, we were in the makeshift seats (the same as they put on the floor, foldables with no real back support.  This was probably the only negative for me as after about an hour, my lower back was killing me (and I still feel it this morning!).  But . . . the seats were wonderful for viewing the show.  Couldn't have been better.  \n\nSound quality was what you'd expect in an arena not built specifically for music, so I didn't have high expectations. \n\nI have to say that I am very impressed by the US Airways Center and all the \""nightmare\"" worries that I had about entering the building, exiting the building, finding something I wanted to drink, and of course, parking, were something I didn't have to be anxious about at all!  Bravo!

Tickets to Phoenix Suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena. $10 tickets and $10.50 [[brews]].

I've driven past this place many times on the way to Suns or D-Backs games.  Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\n\nThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:\n\n- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me \""You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine\"".....I thought she was kidding and I said, \""I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?\""....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said \""No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it\"".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\n\n- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\n\n- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\n\n- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\n\nOverall, not a good experience.  Maybe if I was a young 20 yr old it would be cool...not now.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%

Summer time is supposed to be \""healthy time\"", so I am trying to watch what I eat. Now, I will always be a big guy (not \""two fat twins on their matching motorcycles\"" big, but you know, not little) but I definitely am eating more appropriately. However, I work in an office, and around 11:30, people start to double-think their lunch choices. Yes, the night before, a breakfast bowl from Jimmy Dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection, but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave? Forget it; one \""What are you doing for lunch\"" from a buddy and I was out of there.\n\nAthenian was a prime lunch spot for me for awhile, and just fell out of favor. No time like the present to return, plus SB had never been there before today. We took the 2 minute drive to Central and rolled in to a 1/3 filled Athenian Express. Happy to have missed the rush, I immediately ordered my favorite dish, the gyro feta (no tomatoes/onions, add lettuce) with fries, and SB got a chicken sub and potato salad.\n\nFirst issue, no fountain soda? If I can't destroy myself with aspartame in my free refills, it's not a great lunch. Plus, I don't like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage. Fix yo machine, Athenian!\n\nOutside of the $1.50 soda, the meal was as good as always. It was a bit lighter on the feta than usual (and LOVE me some feta goodness), but still had quite a pile. The meat was thick and cooked through, definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing Greek party. The french fries weren't overcooked, which is good because burned fries suck fully. Add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything, and times were well spent. It's a ton of food for what you pay, and one of the best deals downtown.\n\nMy coworker didn't fair quite as well, but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal. His chicken sub came with a huge breast, which I would think is a good thing, but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed (like I said, weird preferences). He demolished the entire thing, so it must have not been too bad, along with the potato salad, which he was a fan of as well.\n\nAll in all, very good lunch experience. I usually get take-out, but the Greek team had their World Cup game, so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the \""exciting\"" 0-0 match-up. If we can get some fountain sodas up in there, Athenian will likely jump back on my radar (and I may even get a salad.....maybe).

You'll notice a huge age discrepency, really young kids and then there are the adults of all ages.  So I give credz to any insitution that tries to keep kids engaged in using their minds  vs getting their game on in the mall.\n\nI love science museums, making a point to attend in any big city I travel to.  The exhibits seem lacking (even in simple terms) of the magic behind the science... hence probably why the feedback this place is so kids orientated.

This place could be really great, but unfortunately as of now it sucks.\n\nFirst of all, I've never been to a concert venue like this with no bar...  Call me an alcoholic, but I like my beer in hand when I'm nodding my head to some obscure hipster band I've never heard of.\n\nThe outside is kind of cool- but the inside is awful!  The walls are stark white and look like those cheap walls people use to divide up apartments into more bedrooms.  There were no decorations or paintings on the wall when I went even though I thought it was supposed to be some sort of gallery.  Maybe I went on a night that they were between showings.  The space is small, but if they hired a better interior designer they could have made it work.  Unforch, it didn't.  The sound system seemed cheap also.\n\nThis place could be great if they just put in a bar, and hired a decorator.

I am from out of town and have never been to a restaurant at a ball game, so I was excited to go to Front Row to watch the DBacks game. The website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in Front Row for the game, so I gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance. They said I could only purchase tables the day of. I called the night before the game, hoping that maybe they would make an exception because I really wanted these tickets. I then found out that the tickets have been available all season! I asked to speak to the manager, who was the rudest human being I have ever spoke to in my life! After about an hour on the phone with him, tears, and being called a liar, I decided to hang up and just call customer service. I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that \""EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round\""... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him. I just read some previous reviews about him on this site, and it's so funny that everyone agrees with me. If you don't have any issue when you go there, then you'll be fine. But if you have even the slightest complaint that has to go through Lyle.... don't expect to leave happy.

Stumbled across this place while working a photo shoot in the area and we ordered in.  Since then we haven't stopped eating at Athenian Express.   A good five miles out of the way.    What attracted us?  Great food, great prices and the owners wife was undeniable friendly.  Seriously one of the genuinely nicest people I have ever met.   I started out with the Turkey Pita.  Delicious. Yet she urged me to be more creative.   Love it all now including the staff.   There isn't a day where it isn't hussle and bussle in the place,  yet the service is fast and always accurate.  Seriously, I eat it almost every day.

Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.

La Tolteca is outstanding. Passing through PHX and a friend (and frequent visitor to AZ) told me I need to stop here. He spoke truth. \n\nGet the chilaquiles! Get them. \n\nWe also had tacos de papa, and caldo de camarones...the latter was awesome too, delicious broth and packed with shrimp. The salsa bar had grilled jalape\u00f1os & habanero salsa we couldn't get enough of. \n\nI'll be back to La Tolteca. Five stars no hesitation.

This has to be the most ghetto and disrespectful dive I've ever been to. I usually don't play the race card, but unless you are a Spanish speaking Latino you will not be treated well by the staff.\n\nAs soon as I walked up to the counter, a pregnant cashier rolled her eyes and asked dully what I wanted. I couldn't pronounce the name of the combo I wanted but I blurted out the number associated with it and it had a picture. She looked over her shoulder at one of her associates and said something. The only words I caught were \""token gringo customer.\""\n\nThey shared a giggle.  They were speaking in that half-assed Spanish that has a little English mixed in. Suffice it to say I was offended and promptly cancelled the order. I have not returned since then

Not normally, but when an MD dresses in a suit, then I can't stop wondering why...  You get the [[picture]].

The Gucci loafers.  The conferences in New York, Anaheim, Orlando, Miami, etc.  Making $200K  from a regular practice isn't enough?  Are you a doctor or a businessman?   What's more important:  helping the sick or your bottom line (like I want a new boat that costs $260,000 and the down payment is $26,000 so I need to get 23 surgeries done in the next 3 weeks to get that payment together).  If I want you to do my surgery at the Mayo Clinic is this possible?   I want to have surgery at a hospital.  Because, let's say something goes wrong.  Drastically wrong, like I stop breathing.  When this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again.  In a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse.  People die in surgery centers.    When I hear surgery center, I think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available.  \nDr Stevens is arrogant:   i was extremely ill when I had a consultation with him. I had quite a few questions to ask about my situation.  Dr. Stevens kept writing and wouldn't look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions.  He kept looking at his notepad.  Damn it:  stop writing, lift up your head and look at me when I'm talking to you.  While I'm in the middle of this, it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me.  I'm paying for the consultation, I could barely walk, it was June - so it was HOT outside.  I was exhausted, had been out of work for several weeks.  Was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon. He said he does the procedure i need all the time.  Maybe that was true, but he would NOT be doing this on me. As I was walking to the garage so I could collapse in my car, I was almost ready to give up.  I knew I had to go home, get on the internet and find a doctor that I liked.

This might be a good way to kill time if you're near the airport, the food really wasn't that great. It tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time. I had the caldo 7 mares and it was lukewarm, wayyy too salty, and the shrimp were mushy. It was pretty gross. The carne asada tacos were mostly gristle, and I couldn't really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them. For $20, I could've gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else.

I have been going to this ranch market for at least eight years. Here is my review.\nThe foods are not the same as they used to be. We bought some tortillas and they usually last about a week, but they started growing mold about three days after.. never used to be this way. \nThe service we had was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning. The guy at the counter was not very professional and made this face when we asked for eggs, it was like he only wanted us to buy something already made.  When we used to go before they were always more than willing to cook us whatever we needed. On my way back to my table, an employee even walked right into me with no apology!

However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no.

I visit Phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location. The hotel is marginal, but needs some major updates. The breakfast is less than mediocre and seems like they are always low on supply. The last 2 mornings I arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs. Lastly,  the customer service rep (I wont mention any names) who checked me in needed additional training on how to treat loyal customers. She was very rude and short during check in which I find uncommon for the brand.

At 1 PM, we were [[handed]] large [[menus]] with several dozen interesting [[choices]]. Only one seafood [[entree]] (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to [[settle]] for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \n\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was [[instantly]] forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an [[attempt]] at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and [[colorful]].  Service [[seemed]] friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \n\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back.

When I want to go out but not spend $100 on entertainment and also get some exercise in at the same time and see some beautiful Arizona landscape, the Desert Botanical Gardens is the best place I can go. I enjoy walking around the Garden looking at all of the flowers in bloom and all of the different kinds of cactus. I also enjoy when they have different exhibits that you can see as you are wandering the garden. I really enjoyed the Chihuly Glass artwork that was displayed a few years back. \n\nProbably my favorite time of the year to come here is when they have the butterflies. They are so pretty and this year there were so many of them! We went this last weekend on my day off and the weather was perfect and we just had a great time. I also get to brush up on my photography skills here the best because I can take some amazing pictures of flowers and butterflies. \n\nIf you want to see what the Arizona desert is all about, you need to come here to experience it first hand.

I have had terrible luck with this lawn service recently. Please do not furnish Sergio with your credit card number; he will put the card through on PayPal, which is very hard to stop when he is processing fraudulent charges. His crew stole a valuable tree-lopping tool from me at a house I was leasing right before I moved out. Then, after I moved out, he has billed me for monthly services for two months running because, despite being informed by me on the phone, he claims that I have to terminate his services in writing. \nThis is the worst consumer experience I have had in years and I feel that this behavior has to be stopped.

I have ordered Red Devil's pizza and wings for takeout for years now, but today was the first time I dined in the restaurant.  We started with the potato skins which were served slightly overcooked and without any sour cream, which Red Devil does not carry.  (Really? Who serves potato skins without sour cream).  For our entrees, I ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.  I only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that I could not bare another, and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a McDonald's burger and tasted like a \""slightly better quality school lunch burger\"".  These three items and one Pepsi cost us 32 dollars before tip.  All in all, we left hungry and forty dollars poorer.    We will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings.

BEWARE!! \n\nI had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. \n\nPhotos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles \""it must have vibrated off after service.\"" \n\n\nI may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever \""vibrated off\"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car. Hopefully there are other shops are more helpful and honest.

The PHX zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large, charismatic megafauna.  However, if you are like me, you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display.  There is very little of this, the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe, if you are lucky, the country where the animal lives. The zoo is also mammal heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love a good mammal display, but I also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles.  If that is what you like to see, the PHX zoo is not the place for you.  They do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians, but that is it for the herps...  They also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall, they lack the fish, amphibians, and reptiles.  Also, where is the insect collections? Maybe I missed it.\n\nThe animals do have very large enclosures, but some look under kept.  Also, there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species.  They have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now...  a shame...\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo, the admission was pricey, and the breadth of animals small.

When we called the Motel before we arrived, they said they had plenty of rooms available, but when we got there the manager spent about 10 minutes searching for a room for us (said several were in the middle of some maintenance.  As we went to our room, we noticed there were many rooms that did not appear to be occupied at all (the drapes were open and rooms were dark.)  This was the same story and situation the past 3 times we stayed here.  I think they just close rooms off, period.\n\nFound a used condom on floor under the bed and the wall near the sink had some drip stains from something I won't even hazard a guess about. There is no way that room had been properly cleaned or sanitized.  We will absolutely not be back here again.

Don't go here if you have small children. This is a museum for 8 and up. If you are over 8 and have a love for fire engines and their history, then this place is great. This is not a place to go if you have young children that want to climb on everything. You are not even allowed to touch the railings that surround the fire trucks. The children's exhibit and the one firetruck that you are allowed to climb on seem like an afterthought.

I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know, Ajo Al's, Macayo's, Garcia's, etc.  At this point, it is still a treat for me, but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu, dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place.  El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week. \n\nWe showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was [[flavorful]] and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.  I had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again.  We'll be back to El Nopalito often.  I'm excited to try the 99 cent street tacos.

I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know, Ajo Al's, Macayo's, Garcia's, etc.  At this point, it is still a treat for me, but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu, dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place.  El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week. \n\nWe showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was [[sapid]] and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.

OK-so we went to the zoo this past saturday and just our luck it was \""the busiest day of the year so far\"" according to one of the workers.  We had a wonderful time until we got to the paddle boat area and had a horrible customer service experience with an employee named Zach.  We tooled around in the paddle boat for our 20 minute ride and upon leaving went to pick up our $5 deposit.  As we approached the desk Zach raised his voice and said \""you will not be receiving your deposit back because you broke the rules and let your daughter sit in an area that is off limits on the boat.\"" We had no idea what this kid was talking about.  He again raised his voice and people started to stare...he said \""you signed a contract that said she wasn't allowed to sit in the middle of the boat.  You made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your deposit.\""  WOW.  All I can say is if this is such a dire safety issue, why not tell people when they get in the boat?  So ridiculous and quite the scam to keep our $5.  They even had devised a \""hand signal\"" so the person at the cash register would know not to give our money to us.  The most curious thing to us was why didn't they just tell us to have her move over while we were in the boat?  They never mentioned it to us.  It seriously ruined our trip.  Zach, you really take your job way too seriously dude.  Oh, and I stopped payment on my debit card-take that!

Came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in NYC's Chinatown. I know it's really not fair to compare this place with what we had in NYC, but I definitely left disappointed. \n\nThe service was lightening fast, but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we weren't Asian. For example, soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon, but we received no utensils to eat them with at all. \n\nThe eggplant was good, but was saltier and more sour than I was expecting. My mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate. \n\nOverall, I would say good effort for Phoenix, but I won't be returning.

Tried this place on a lazy Sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews, and I would [[say]] what others have said is pretty accurate. It is very authentic, [[looks]] like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. [[But]], the tacos here are [[great]]!

[[Each]] were very [[good]] in their own unique [[ways]], the meat was good quality and everything [[had]] the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, [[so]] much that I had to go back and order another one! [[I]] also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nSo far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She [[got]] a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco looked [[good]], and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well. \n\nThey also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful. Our server was very friendly, patient, nice and helpful. \n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a good taco shop, nothing fancy, and authentic, this might be your best bet.

Came here for a drug screen for a new job. Tried to call for 2 days to set up a time to come in. Time is money. Every time I tried to call the number listed the call would ring and then just disconnect. So due to the fact there is a time expiration on the drug screen. Came in to get it done. Show up, find out there is over an hour wait just to pee in a cup. Ask if there is any way I can just go because this whole procedure is going to take less the a minute to do. Ask to speak to a manager. David. Who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells I can either wait or leave. I explain I have been trying to call the location to set up a time were he basically tells me that there is nothing wrong with the phones he has been talking on them all day. But I have been here over 30 minutes now and have not heard the phone ring once. Overall the place is dirty. The wait is ridiculous especially for a basic drug screen and the staff is extremely rude. I highly suggest never ever coming here. I know I will never be back. Ever.

Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!

This place should be categorize as a shit bar instead of a dive bar! \n\nCalled about 1:30 and ask about employment there and was told by some bitch working there said \""no we are not hiring\"" and then with her stupid uneducated trailer trash bitch attitude ass added \""if you are in the business,  you should know not to call during lunch!\"" \n\nIts 1:30, past lunch time \""rush\"" and this bitch had to open her probably fat, pimple faced mouth and give this rude comment?! This was so uncalled for!!\n\nSo I went in this shitty place to complain (so glad I did not applied at this nasty ass place-which I did not understand why anybody else did not smell or see how nasty this place really is!) and asked for the manager. This  nasty toothless so called\""waitress\"" said he was bartending and was busy! I still spoke to this (piece of shit Is way too much nice of a word for this asshole!)manager and was treated again like a piece shit and he bitched me out saying \""if you are not a customer, I don't have time for your shit and come back later!!\"" \n\nWell the only time I would come back to this shitty bar if I ever wanted a staff infection or hepatitis from the gross bathrooms! \n\nHow can anybody eat at a place where the management treats anyone this way??!!  I would never eat here and wouldn't anyone else eat at this place!!

Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no

This placement doesn't even deserve a star so I guess one will do. The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds. This is the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had in my life and I don't think I ever want to go to an Applebee's if this is the kind of service I get. Over to you Mr. Applebee's CEO.

No, no, no, no. That's all I can say if you are planning on eating here.  \n\nMy daughter and I went in today, on a Sunday afternoon, because we couldn't find another Mexican restaurant that was open on Sunday in central Phoenix. The service was fine but the food was awful. The beans tasted like they came from a can (Rosarita brand) and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason. We each ate only half of our food before  leaving.  \n\nWhen the waiter asked how the food was, I told him and all he did was say he was sorry. No offer to bring something else or comp one of our half-eaten meals. \n\nMacayo's on Central used to have fresh food, now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can. You can definitely tell that they are cutting corners in the kitchen. For the prices they charge, You have a right to expect better food. \n\nI will never go there again.

It's my little sister's 17th birthday (yes, I feel old considering I remember changing her diapers!) and I wanted to do something special for her.

So I sent them an email explaining the situation and asked ever so nicely that they please try to deliver before 2pm. Just over an hour later, which was after noon in Arizona - less than 2 hours before my requested delivery time - I received a response that it was taken care of. How great is that?!?! \n\nI'm still waiting to get a call from my sister (I'm sure I'll post an update later today to say how it turned out), but right now they have a very satisfied customer! \n\nThe Cactus Flower Exclusives are gorgeous and go for $35 and up (+ tax and delivery, which is $13 - $15). National deliveries also start at $35 + tax and delivery. \n\n- 1 Star because the bouquet arrangements most people lean towards start at about $50, which is kinda pricey (only smaller arrangements with a handful of short stem flowers in a short vase are $35)

I ordered flowers for two friends. When I spoke to the designer about the size he was more then helpful with exchanging some of the flowers to create a bigger bouquet. It's almost two weeks later and my friend said they still look beautiful just as when they arrived. Both friends said they were lovely. I will use them again.

They sell the exact same things as food city for 4x the price (same company owns fry's, food city, and AJ's) because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of AJ's will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the Spanish Mass at their local catholic church, and worthy of more than $2 apiece.\n\nFurthermore, more whole and organic foods are sold at any one Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Fresh and Easy, and Whole Foods than any AJ's that ever existed.\n\nAvoid this place unless you're a yuppie with too much money and not enough sense, or unless you think one of the sommeliers is hot. 2 stars for the awesome beer selection.

The fact that they are right next to Lux is also a plus.\n\nHowever, I can't say the same about dinner where I had the lasagna...For $ 16, it was an abomination, all there was in there was some tomato sauce, bechamel and meat sauce...no cheese or meat sauce...altogether a huge disappointment.

When I lived a block from Pane Bianco, I used to make it a point to spend (and eat) as little as possible throughout the week just to be able to grab one of their sandwiches (preferably the mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich) on the weekend.\n\nA little pricey, but worth every penny; the food is crafted so well that you start to dream about it and wonder when you can run back for more. If you're a coffee or tea fan, it's perfectly paired with Lux right next door; ample seating to eat your sandwich in peace and enjoy the people watching.

I was across the street for a Dr appointment and decided to step into the AJs after to browse since it was \""right there\"". Haven't been into one in years for the same reason that I probably won't return after the recent visit: way overpriced for things I can buy elsewhere. Almost everything in the store you can buy at any regular grocery store, and pay less for it. They do carry a small number of \""gourmet\"" items on the shelves, but I can find those other places, too. \n\nSo, you'd think that their deli or bakery or something would stand out, but not that I can tell. I was going to try something from the bakery case but it was all way overpriced and totally unimpressive looking. I was there in the AM so I did try a slice of the breakfast pizza that was out in the deli. First off, it took me several minutes to be served because the staff was busily ignoring me. Then when I did finally get my slice, I went to pay and eat it, and the thing was cold and chewy. The crust was just so tough. The eggs were somewhat dried out. I was seriously underwhelmed. \n\nThe store was practically dead the whole time I was wandering around. The staff outnumbered the patrons BY FAR. How do these places stay in business? You won't get more money from me AJ's!

I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it.

Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).  We won't be going back.

I really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because I want to like it so badly! The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong! \nNow, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville.

Wow. Just, wow. As a former employee of this location, I'm sorely disappointed. I used to be a hostess here and always LOVED the food. So I figured I'd take my boyfriend to grab a nice breakfast. Boy was I wrong. I ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo (always been my favorite) and ended up with eggs and bland potatoes, with chunky sour cream (ew) and a light sprinkling of chorizo. Um, what? I paid almost 30 bucks for this? The food was bland and not good at all. I couldn't even finish my meal it was that bad. I'll never go back. How disappointing. Maybe you should stop recruiting your employees/chefs from McDonalds. The good egg has really let itself go.

The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room. As I walked through the restaurant, I was surprised it was so busy...I mean this IS a breakfast place, right? \n\nThe decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter EVERYWHERE. I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. \n\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. \n\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am. \n\nI had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad. \n\nI am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week. Nico did point out that I have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any EGG dish. Maybe next time...

I like their variety in products, however they always have peddlers there asking for money and making people uncomfortable, but they don't seem to do anything about it.\n\nAlso almost every single time I go to the pharmacy, they never have my prescription ready, even after they've called me to tell me it was ready. One day I called it in about 3 days early, just to make sure I could stop by anytime before I ran out to pick up my prescription.It turned out I wasn't able to pick it up until the day that I ran out anyway, and even though I had called in three days earlier, it still wasn't ready! To add to this frustration, I have gone in and waited for up to 3 hours for prescription to be ready, when I was told it would only take 15 to 30 minutes. Lastly, they have the automatic prescription refill, when they call you to tell you that it's ready when your prescription runs out. I signed up for this, however they didn't call me the last time I had a refillb ready because they weren't aware it needed to be refilled, and the time before that they called me to tell me it was ready and when I showed up it wasn't ready. I'm sick of waiting here and eating my time for my prescriptions. I am taking my business elsewhere.

The only [[reason]] I'm [[giving]] this place [[two]] [[stars]] instead of one star is because I really had a good appointment with Whitney Padgett, the nurse practitioner. She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a [[good]] listener. [[However]], in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and [[I]] decide to [[have]] a baby. [[I]] was a happy patient of my last doctor for 12 [[years]].  I [[scheduled]] my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was [[seen]] by Whitney Padgett. It [[has]] always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time [[going]] to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that [[I]] was [[seen]] only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I [[returned]] for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I [[came]] to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \""Are you sexually active?\"" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience.

However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \""Are you sexually active?\"" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience.

i am a sucker for this place. its not that is soooo fantastic, its that to me when i go to phoenix/scottsdale (to visit my snowmama)  i feel like im kinda in that albert brooks/meryl streep movie that i love where they die and are in some pre-heaven place where they can eat shit all day and never get fat so the portions are huge and obscene. i dont know why retired people get more food than the rest of us,  but the sad reality is that we do get fat when we eat huge amounts of shit. \n\nand while you can still get fat eating at this place (watch out for the choc chip cookies and the entire hot food section), you can be good, and pick the healthy good stuff and go back and feel good about yourself. its hard cause even though that pizza aint that good, after broccoli it aint bad. and again, those choc chip cookies are all over you- i dont really get why they cant leave them at the buffet but have to have some waiter come offer them to you ever 5 seconds. if you have some will power, its pretty [[good]].

FILTHY! I ordered the 9oz house sirloin via Delicious Deliveries. The delivery was very late (not Applebees fault) and I wish we hadn't ordered from there even before I tasted my food. The serving portion was small considering the amount of money I'd paid. The mashed potatoes were filthy and the steak was like rubber, if it even was steak. I've had better steak from Swanson's frozen dinners! I asked for well done, not rubberized! I've never had such filthy food via delivery before. If I had been in the restaurant I would've sent it back, no doubt! Add insult to injury they didn't even include my side of veggies. So I feel completely ripped off and the food was nasty to top it off. I won't be going back here again! Worst experience!

I live and own my property for 11 years and the HOA will not do anything about the animal problem that has been happening for the past two years.  This cat keeps coming to sleep, release its feces, attacking birds and eating them on my property.  The HOA property manager Judy O'Claire tried to put blame on the Glendale Code Compliance as well as vice versa.  Nobody wants to take responsibility and now I have to confront the neighbors at 6402 W Lawrence Lane, hopefully I don't get shot at.  I don't understand why this management company does not take responsibility and continues to not enforce the CC&Rs.  For nine years they kept sending me warnings about my garbage containers being exposed on my yard and a few weed warnings which was not true, and now I have to deal with somebody else's wandering pet because the darn property manager thinks it's my problem.  Those neighbors need to stop feeding all the cats from this and other neighborhoods and start taking responsibility or jail, including Osselaer Company who will land in jail too.  Judy O\""Claire is a racist and discriminates against disabled homeowners, she will deceive that she does not know who I am when I have confronted her over two dozen times during the 11 years I've lived there.  Beware if you are having problems with the property managers, go to the president of the company.

One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.\n\nI'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.\n\nOh well.

Last year, our very active toddler (then 2-yrs-old) was diagnosed with a bone cyst in his femur. Our pediatrician gave us a list of orthopedic surgeons to consult and although Dr. Shindell was at the top of the list, we actually went to the second name -- one of the largest orthopedic groups in the valley -- first. When we met with that first surgeon, he said he could help our son but given the size and placement of the cyst and the risk of it breaking, he recommended that we go to someone who handles these type of cases more often. We asked who he would recommend if it were his son, and he said Dr. Shindell.\n\nWhen we called Dr. Shindell's office, they were able to get us in for an appointment the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely anxious, but Dr. Shindell's calm demeanor and extensive experience helped us worry less. He explained all the options (including a brand new procedure that just finished clinical trials) and possible long-term effects. There was absolutely no pressure to take any one option over the others, and he was willing to give us the weekend to think over our options.\n\nIt took us about 20-minutes to decide what to do. Dr. Shindell immediately set up the surgery date and called Hanger Orthotics to squeezed us in for a fitting even though it was the end of day on a Friday.\n\nThe following week, our son had his surgery (would have been sooner, but we had to wait for his custom brace to be made). Dr. Shindell met us at the hospital to explain the details of the surgery ahead of time. After the surgery, he met us in the waiting room and explained the recovery plan and what to expect. Shindell again checked on our son the following day to see how he was recovering. Every time, he explained everything fully so that we could understand what was going on.\n\nWe still see Dr. Shindell regularly to check on the progress of our son's bone graft. Although he seemed very stoic when we first met him, we also have seen how much he personally cares about each patient... and their parents.\n\nWe are absolutely grateful for Dr. Shindell!

Oregano's on Camelback is one of our favorite places to go for dinner & some beers. We always take out of town guests there.\n\nThe outdoor seating in particular is one of our favorite places to hang out, eat and drink. You can enjoy your food while relaxing in an oasis-like environment outside, enjoying the breeze, the sun or a sunset. Good music is always playing (jazz and other boppy tunes) and they have heaters over the tables outside for when it gets cold at night.\n\nThey have a decent beer and wine selection, including some good ones for beer connoisseurs. Pitchers of beer pricing is reasonable.\n\nThe food is fantastic. For appetizers, we really like the Guacatoni (quesadilla served with fresh guac) and the spicy ravioli's. Pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones. There's also a good variety of pastas and salads.\n\nFor us, it doesn't get much better then Oregano's. Yes, the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes, there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside, but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks.

So let's get this out of the way up front: The food here's pretty good. There I said it. [[I]] always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to [[make]] me return to a place to eat. We usually get [[takeout]] from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get [[takeout]] form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't [[be]] [[making]] me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to [[order]] the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT. (Yes, the gas station)

Absolutely delicious, and a very pleasant surprise.  While it seems like a little strip mall joint, it's really quite pretty inside.\n\nThe menu is extensive, and full of vegetarian options (important for me, a veggie).  We shared the ginger eggplant app to start, and then shared some veggie rolls as well. One diner got the chicken parm (oh yes...they also have Italian food...and yummy banana bread along with white rolls), two of us got only sushi, and I got the mushroom tofu dish.\n\nEveryone cleared their plates. Very tasty, and quite affordable.\n\nOne thought - their mixed drinks, at the least the specialty ones, are really odd. I definitely won't be ordering that again. However, everything else was tasty, and we'll be back. Just don't go if you're in a hurry - service left something to be desired. Like the bill.
